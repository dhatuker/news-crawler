[2020-07-28 16:48:11.115620] INFO NewsParser:222: content : SINGAPORE — For dragging a traffic police officer with his car for more than 100m in an escape bid, a Maserati driver was on Tuesday (July 28) sentenced to a lifetime disqualification from driving, on top of four years and seven months in prison and a S$3,700 fine. Lee Cheng Yan, 36, was convicted of 10 charges in December last year, including voluntarily causing grievous hurt to a public servant, failing to stop after an accident and obstructing justice.  On Nov 17, 2017, Lee, who was banned from driving at the time, drove his Maserati to collect a laptop from a man at Bedok Reservoir Road.  Police officer Khairulanwar Abd Kahar — who was in uniform and on a patrol motorcycle - had spotted him driving without his seat belt on and signalled for him to stop.  Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar’s uniform later got caught in the driver’s door of the car and he was dragged along with the moving vehicle. Lee drove 124m with the officer hanging onto the door, at a speed of 79kmh to 84kmh.  The officer later fell off and was given more than 20 days' of medical leave for injuries to his knee, neck and back and later medically downgraded by the Home Team's medical board. Read also: Maserati driver who dragged police officer in escape bid misses sentencing for third time Lee had previously denied being the driver of the Maserati, testifying in court that it was a person named Kelvin — who he said was of similar build and wearing a similar white T-shirt — who drove the vehicle on that day.  For voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, Lee faced a maximum jail term of 15 years and a fine or caning. He had failed to turn up in court for sentencing on three previous occasions as he was on medical leave, having obtained a medical certificate from a private clinic on all three dates.  Read also: Maserati driver found guilty of dragging cop more than 100m in hit-and-run Deputy Public Prosecutor Senthilkumaran Sabapathy had sought for Lee to be sentenced to four years and nine months imprisonment, in addition to a fine and being barred from driving for life.  He cited numerous offences Lee had been convicted of since 2011 —  including driving without a licence and illegal modification of his car’s exhaust system — as well as a 2016 incident where his vehicle collided with a motorcycle, injuring the rider and his pillion rider.  Mr Sabapathy noted Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar continues to feel pain in his lower back, and that his injuries and subsequent medical downgrading had affected his chances for career advancement.  Read also: Maserati owner says he lent car to a man named ‘Kelvin’ and was not driver in alleged hit-and-run "SPUN AN ENTIRE FAIRYTALE" Stating Lee had not been deterred by previous driving disqualifications and that he had “already hurt enough people on the road”, Mr Sabapathy said there was no reason for imposing anything less than a lifetime disqualification order.  He added that Lee had “all but spun an entire fairytale” in his earlier defence that someone else had been driving the Maserati at the time.  Lee's defence lawyer S Balamurugan however said that a lifetime ban would be plainly excessive, asking for a more appropriate term of disqualification in addition to no more than 24 months in prison.  Mr Balamurugan noted that Lee was taking care of his brother, who had intellectual disabilities as well as behavioural problems, while Lee’s parents also had a litany of medical conditions.  He added that Lee had not seen his two young daughters for more than a year, and that his Japanese wife was currently unable to enter the country.  The victim had not suffered a head on collision and his injuries were on the lower end of the grievous hurt scale, he said, adding that Lee had driven only about 19kmh above the 60kmh speed limit.  The prosecution however said that a sentence of four years and nine months in prison was proportionate to the totality of offences committed by Lee in this instance.  Lee intends to appeal against his conviction and sentencing.

On April 5, the two NEA enforcement officers had spotted the man, a Singaporean, smoking at a non-designated smoking table belonging to a coffee shop at Block 12, Telok Blangah Crescent.  The officers approached him and asked for his particulars, but he did not cooperate and ran away.  The officers then gave chase, and when one of them caught up with the man at Block 26, Telok Blangah Crescent, the man shoved his arm against the officer and used his hand to grab the officer's neck. The man also shouted vulgarities at the officer.  The police received a call for assistance from an NEA enforcement officer regarding the altercation and the man was later arrested. In a news release, the police said that the suspect will be charged with voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, and with using abusive language against a public servant.

The syndicate allegedly used details stolen from credit card holders in Singapore using phishing emails to make a series of fraudulent online purchases of electronic products in Hong Kong.  Five core members of the syndicate, three Hong Kong women and two foreign men aged between 26 and 37, were arrested by Hong Kong police on July 6 for their suspected involvement in several cases of online credit card fraud in the city.  Investigations showed the syndicate used credit card details stolen from at least 21 Singaporean victims, who had received emails purportedly from a technology and media services provider to update their payment details.  "These victims were then re-directed to a URL impersonating the services provider’s website where they were deceived into entering their credit card details and one-time passwords," said Singapore police.  "Most of the victims only realised that they had been scammed when they discovered unauthorised transactions in their credit/debit card statements."

The syndicate is also believed to have been involved in other fraudulent online transactions amounting to more than HK$1,300,000 using stolen credit card information from victims in the United States, as well as European countries such as Italy and Portugal. The case is now under investigation by the Commercial Crime Bureau of the Hong Kong police.  Read also: Close to 400 Covid-19-related scams reported, S$1.4 million cheated from January to April "The transnational crime syndicate had targeted unsuspecting victims in many jurisdictions, including Singapore. They had phished for the victims’ banking details through sophisticated sham operations and had used the stolen credit card details to defraud online merchants in Hong Kong," said Mr David Chew, director of SPF's Commercial Affairs Department. "A transnational response is needed to effectively counter this threat. SPF will continue to collaborate closely with our foreign counterparts to detect and deter such transnational syndicates who attempt to use the anonymity of the Internet to commit serious crimes across territorial boundaries," Mr Chew added.

[2020-07-28 16:49:52.433652] INFO NewsParser:222: content :   SINGAPORE — With the investment environment highly uncertain, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC saw lower returns in its latest 20-year assessment period and it will be looking to take on a more active investment approach ahead. This is especially in light of the greater challenges brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.  On Tuesday (July 28), the investment manager of Singapore’s reserves reported an annual return of 2.7 per cent — over and above the global inflation rate of about 2 per cent — across a 20-year period from April 2000 to March 2020.  It is lower than the 3.4 per cent annualised real rate of return from the previous 20-year period and is also the second lowest annualised real rate of return since GIC’s inception in 1981.  The lowest was 2.6 per cent, which was for the 20-year period ending in March 2009, a time when the global economy was besieged by the global financial crisis.  During a briefing with the media on Monday, GIC’s chief executive officer Lim Chow Kiat said that the timing and shape of an economic recovery is highly uncertain.  The evolution of the Covid-19 crisis would depend on three factors: How the virus progresses in terms of the development of a vaccine and the impact on a country’s healthcare system The spillover effects on the economy How the pandemic affects consumer behaviours, as well as a country’s macro-policy responses  REASONS FOR DROP IN RETURNS Mr Lim said that the drop in the returns this time is mainly because the financial year ending March 2000 was excluded from the 20-year assessment period, and less so because of the inclusion of Financial Year 2019/20.  Global markets were doing very well during FY1999/2000 due to the technology bubble.  Dr Jeffrey Jaensubhakij, GIC’s group chief investment officer, said that GIC already started taking a more defensive stance in investment decisions going into the previous financial year due to the high valuations in the market.  The sovereign wealth fund manages most of the Government’s financial assets and invests in a wide range of assets. Besides investing in companies that had a stable income coming in, Dr Jaensubhakij said that GIC also sold some of its assets that had become too expensive and turned the money into dry powder or cash reserves. Compared with the previous financial year, GIC has increased its portfolio share in nominal bonds and cash in this latest one ending in March 2020 and reduced the proportion invested in equities in developed and emerging markets due to the higher risks in these asset classes.  As for whether this downward trend will continue in the future, Dr Jaensubhakij said that most of the 20 years after the turn of the century was a “very poor period for global equity”.  With high valuations still an issue in the future, he said that it will still be a “tough environment” ahead.  SHIFT IN INVESTMENT APPROACH Due to an uncertain future and the issue of high valuations in some asset classes such as bonds, Mr Lim said that there will be greater divergence across countries, sectors and companies.  “In terms of investment approach, we have to go deeper, we have to be more bottom-up, we have to go earlier in our investment value chain… (unlike) in the past where you could enjoy kind of a passive approach in asset allocation in particular,” he said in response to questions from the media.  He added that the “bottom-up” approach has been the strategy that GIC has taken in the last few years. This includes working more closely with entrepreneurs and companies, funding them at a very early stage and connecting them with GIC’s networks.  Amplitude, a cloud startup that tracks online behaviours, as well as food-technology startup Apeel Sciences, are two examples of enterprises that GIC invested in the early stages of their growth.  AVAILABLE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES With the global economy focused on fighting Covid-19, Mr Lim said that healthcare and technology have emerged as the clear sector winners among investors.  However, he said that there are opportunities in other industries because the costs of investing in those sectors have gone down due to the pandemic.  Some examples include the consumer and infrastructure sectors that could make a comeback in a post-Covid-19 world, especially companies that are able to respond to change and have sufficient balance sheets.  Dr Jaensubhakij also said that data centres and logistics are another two sectors that are worth looking into due to changes brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.  However, he said that the GIC team has to be careful when assessing these companies even though their valuations have gone down.  There are those that may never make a comeback after Covid-19, while others may recover three years from now.

Nevertheless, he noted that the “strong desire” from Singaporeans for a greater diversity of views in politics and for more robust debate of policies and plans is “here to stay”, and that the political system will need to evolve to accommodate it, he said at the swearing-in ceremony of the new Cabinet. “Whatever our political persuasions, never forget that we are first and foremost Singaporeans,” PM Lee said in a televised speech from the Istana. The downsized ceremony held in the midst of a pandemic was attended by about 200 invited guests — all wearing masks and seated a distance apart — including senior civil servants, foreign diplomats and newly elected Members of Parliament (MPs), split between two venues: The Istana and the Parliament House.

Some were sworn in from the Parliament House, witnessed by the President and Chief Justice virtually at the Istana through a live video feed.

New officeholders will also bring fresh ideas and perspectives, he added. There were seven new political appointments, of which six were debutants in GE2020. Among them is Dr Tan See Leng, who now takes on three ministerial roles, as being Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and Second Minister for Manpower and for Trade and Industry.

While the Government will formally designate Workers’ Party (WP) chief Pritam Singh as the Leader of the Opposition, PM Lee reiterated his hope that the nine other newly elected WP MPs and the two Non-Constituency MPs from the Progress Singapore Party will play their role of a “responsible and loyal opposition”. “Their duty is not merely to raise criticisms and ask questions of the Government, necessary as these functions are, but also, more importantly, to put forward serious policy alternatives to be scrutinised and debated,” he said. PM Lee with Workers' Party Chief Pritam Singh at the Istana on Monday (July 27). Photo: Ministry of Communications and Information The immediate duty of the Government will be to tackle the public health threat of Covid-19, as cities such as Hong Kong and Seoul, which initially brought the virus under control, have suffered repeat outbreaks after reopening their economies, he said. He added that Singapore also faces the enormous task of getting the economy running again, after it shrank a record 12.6 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter this year. Noting that the four national Budgets this year have staved off the worst of the damage, he said: “Economic conditions will continue to be difficult and we must expect to lose many more jobs. We will do our best to save as many as we can and help workers who still lose their jobs to find new work.” The Government is committed to help businesses hard hit by Covid-19, such as those in the construction, tourism and aviation sectors, he added. But it cannot afford to prop up failing industries indefinitely or trap workers in jobs that are no longer viable. That is why, he said, the better solution is for the Government to redouble efforts to invest in new capabilities, grow new industries and help workers reskill for the new jobs that will be created. Beyond the crisis, the Government must also fulfil the broader ambitions that Singaporeans have for the country, he said. “We aspire to be a fair and just society, with opportunities for all. We wish to fashion an inclusive community, where we look out for one another, reach out to those who need help, and show every Singaporean that they have a stake in our future," he said. “We want to make this a home where Singaporeans always believe their children will have better lives than themselves, and the human spirit can flourish. This is the nation we are building together.”

[2020-07-28 16:51:42.852582] INFO NewsParser:222: content : SINGAPORE — A graduation ceremony for a polytechnic student turned ugly after another man turned up to meet the graduate's ex-girlfriend, escalating into a scuffle. Two other men later joined in and assaulted the victim, who sustained swollen lips, a bleeding eyelid and multiple bruises. For one charge of using criminal force on the victim, 22-year-old Lee Qi Xiang was on Monday (July 27) sentenced to 15 months' probation. He will also have to perform 60 hours of community service, and his mother put up a bond of S$5,000 to ensure his good behaviour. The court heard that Lee, then 21, was at Ngee Ann Polytechnic on May 3 last year for his graduation ceremony. His ex-girlfriend Nicole Lum Chee Yi was also at the polytechnic, waiting for Lee's graduation ceremony to end.  Read also: Entertainment lawyer Samuel Seow pleads guilty to assaulting, threatening 3 employees including niece The victim, 21-year-old Tan Kah Lock, had gone to the school to meet Ms Lum. When she told him that the ceremony had ended, Mr Tan walked over to meet her. While Mr Tan was on his way, Lee spotted him and walked towards him. He confronted Mr Tan and questioned him on why he was there with Ms Lum. A dispute broke out between the two men, and Ms Lum intervened and asked Mr Tan to leave.

A medical report noted several injuries sustained by Mr Tan, including bruises on his arm, abdomen and eye, laceration over his eyebrow and scratch marks over his face and abdominal area. Lee later admitted to pushing Mr Tan from behind to get his attention and pushing him during the confrontation because he was angry with him. The victim said he felt alarmed by these actions. The cases of the two co-accused are being dealt with separately. Lim pleaded guilty to voluntarily causing hurt and was given 15 months' probation last month. For using criminal force, Lee could have been jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$1,500, or both. CNA For more news like this, visit cna.asia

[2020-07-28 16:52:16.568065] INFO NewsParser:222: content :   SINGAPORE — While heavily intoxicated, a 26-year-old man decided to set fire to a Singapore flag hanging along the corridor of a block of flats along Woodlands Crescent, where he lived.  Remnants of the burning flag fell, leading to seven other flags hung at lower floors getting damaged. Elson Ong Yong Liang was sentenced to 16 weeks, or about four months, of jail time on Monday (July 27) for his actions, after pleading guilty about a week ago to one count of mischief by fire.  Two other such charges, related to other instances of him setting things on fire, were taken into consideration for sentencing. The court heard that Ong went drinking at a pub along Selegie Road on Aug 3 last year, a few days before National Day on Aug 9.  At about 5.30am the next day, he took a Grab car home while extremely drunk. It was not stated how much alcohol he had drunk. He arrived at the Housing and Development Board block where he lived at about 6am, then stood in front of a 13th-floor unit and decided to light a cigarette.  It was not stated if he lived on that floor. When he noticed a Singapore flag hung along the outer walls of the block, he decided to set it on fire with his lighter.  Several hours later around noon, a 48-year-old man residing in the unit near where Ong had stood smoking called the police to report the burnt flag. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Kor Zhen Hong sought six months’ jail, reffering to aggravating factors such as public disquiet.  Members of the public passing by “would be quite concerned” if they saw the burning flag, DPP Kor added. However, he acknowledged that no one had reported that the flag was burning at the time. Ong’s lawyer, Mr Gino Hardial Singh, said that his client’s actions were “reprehensible” but asked the court to take into account some mitigating factors for sentencing. He referenced an Institute of Mental Health (IMH) report, which stated that Ong during his teenager years had developed a habit of burning paper when stressed.  He would usually gather flyers at void decks of public housing blocks and burn them in incense bins or grass patches.  A psychiatrist noted that this was a “mild adaptive coping mechanism” to stress, Mr Singh told the court. Court documents showed that Ong had set fire to newspapers outside another flat on April 4 last year, which destroyed the newspapers, a cupboard and fuse box. In another incident on an unknown date, he placed his lighter against a metal barricade at a lift lobby causing a construction sign sticker pasted on the barricade to catch fire.  Mr Singh, who asked for three months’ jail instead, said that Ong had learned his lesson and “is now on the right path”. He had been abused by his father at a young age and his parents divorced when he was six years old, the lawyer added. In response, DPP Kor said that the IMH report “clearly gives an opinion that he does not suffer from pyromania”. Individuals suffering from it cannot control their impulse to set fire to things. He was likely drunk and this is generally an aggravating factor, the prosecutor said. Ong could have been jailed up to seven years and fined.

[2020-07-28 16:55:26.378941] INFO NewsParser:222: content : SINGAPORE — Local tours run by operators and tourist guides can now have bigger groups, as long as safe distancing measures are in place between sub-groups of participants, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said on Tuesday (July 28). Tours involving transport such as buses can take up to 50 people or at the vehicle's maximum operating capacity after implementation of safe management measures, whichever is lower. Local walking, cycling and kayaking tours are limited to a maximum of 10 people excluding the tour guide. All tours have to ensure that there are not more than five people in a sub-group. At least 1m distance has to be maintained between the sub-groups and there should be no intermingling. Tours also cannot exceed eight hours, STB said. The easing of guidelines comes after the launch of a S$45 million tourism campaign urging locals to explore Singapore, with packages and promotions on offer.

[2020-07-28 16:55:59.988116] INFO NewsParser:222: content : SINGAPORE — For dragging a traffic police officer with his car for more than 100m in an escape bid, a Maserati driver was on Tuesday (July 28) sentenced to a lifetime disqualification from driving, on top of four years and seven months in prison and a S$3,700 fine. Lee Cheng Yan, 36, was convicted of 10 charges in December last year, including voluntarily causing grievous hurt to a public servant, failing to stop after an accident and obstructing justice.  On Nov 17, 2017, Lee, who was banned from driving at the time, drove his Maserati to collect a laptop from a man at Bedok Reservoir Road.  Police officer Khairulanwar Abd Kahar — who was in uniform and on a patrol motorcycle - had spotted him driving without his seat belt on and signalled for him to stop.  Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar’s uniform later got caught in the driver’s door of the car and he was dragged along with the moving vehicle. Lee drove 124m with the officer hanging onto the door, at a speed of 79kmh to 84kmh.  The officer later fell off and was given more than 20 days' of medical leave for injuries to his knee, neck and back and later medically downgraded by the Home Team's medical board. Read also: Maserati driver who dragged police officer in escape bid misses sentencing for third time Lee had previously denied being the driver of the Maserati, testifying in court that it was a person named Kelvin — who he said was of similar build and wearing a similar white T-shirt — who drove the vehicle on that day.  For voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, Lee faced a maximum jail term of 15 years and a fine or caning. He had failed to turn up in court for sentencing on three previous occasions as he was on medical leave, having obtained a medical certificate from a private clinic on all three dates.  Read also: Maserati driver found guilty of dragging cop more than 100m in hit-and-run Deputy Public Prosecutor Senthilkumaran Sabapathy had sought for Lee to be sentenced to four years and nine months imprisonment, in addition to a fine and being barred from driving for life.  He cited numerous offences Lee had been convicted of since 2011 —  including driving without a licence and illegal modification of his car’s exhaust system — as well as a 2016 incident where his vehicle collided with a motorcycle, injuring the rider and his pillion rider.  Mr Sabapathy noted Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar continues to feel pain in his lower back, and that his injuries and subsequent medical downgrading had affected his chances for career advancement.  Read also: Maserati owner says he lent car to a man named ‘Kelvin’ and was not driver in alleged hit-and-run "SPUN AN ENTIRE FAIRYTALE" Stating Lee had not been deterred by previous driving disqualifications and that he had “already hurt enough people on the road”, Mr Sabapathy said there was no reason for imposing anything less than a lifetime disqualification order.  He added that Lee had “all but spun an entire fairytale” in his earlier defence that someone else had been driving the Maserati at the time.  Lee's defence lawyer S Balamurugan however said that a lifetime ban would be plainly excessive, asking for a more appropriate term of disqualification in addition to no more than 24 months in prison.  Mr Balamurugan noted that Lee was taking care of his brother, who had intellectual disabilities as well as behavioural problems, while Lee’s parents also had a litany of medical conditions.  He added that Lee had not seen his two young daughters for more than a year, and that his Japanese wife was currently unable to enter the country.  The victim had not suffered a head on collision and his injuries were on the lower end of the grievous hurt scale, he said, adding that Lee had driven only about 19kmh above the 60kmh speed limit.  The prosecution however said that a sentence of four years and nine months in prison was proportionate to the totality of offences committed by Lee in this instance.  Lee intends to appeal against his conviction and sentencing.

The syndicate allegedly used details stolen from credit card holders in Singapore using phishing emails to make a series of fraudulent online purchases of electronic products in Hong Kong.  Five core members of the syndicate, three Hong Kong women and two foreign men aged between 26 and 37, were arrested by Hong Kong police on July 6 for their suspected involvement in several cases of online credit card fraud in the city.  Investigations showed the syndicate used credit card details stolen from at least 21 Singaporean victims, who had received emails purportedly from a technology and media services provider to update their payment details.  "These victims were then re-directed to a URL impersonating the services provider’s website where they were deceived into entering their credit card details and one-time passwords," said Singapore police.  "Most of the victims only realised that they had been scammed when they discovered unauthorised transactions in their credit/debit card statements."

The syndicate is also believed to have been involved in other fraudulent online transactions amounting to more than HK$1,300,000 using stolen credit card information from victims in the United States, as well as European countries such as Italy and Portugal.

They had phished for the victims’ banking details through sophisticated sham operations and had used the stolen credit card details to defraud online merchants in Hong Kong," said Mr David Chew, director of SPF's Commercial Affairs Department. "A transnational response is needed to effectively counter this threat. SPF will continue to collaborate closely with our foreign counterparts to detect and deter such transnational syndicates who attempt to use the anonymity of the Internet to commit serious crimes across territorial boundaries," Mr Chew added.

This is especially in light of the greater challenges brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.  On Tuesday (July 28), the investment manager of Singapore’s reserves reported an annual return of 2.7 per cent — over and above the global inflation rate of about 2 per cent — across a 20-year period from April 2000 to March 2020.  It is lower than the 3.4 per cent annualised real rate of return from the previous 20-year period and is also the second lowest annualised real rate of return since GIC’s inception in 1981.  The lowest was 2.6 per cent, which was for the 20-year period ending in March 2009, a time when the global economy was besieged by the global financial crisis.  During a briefing with the media on Monday, GIC’s chief executive officer Lim Chow Kiat said that the timing and shape of an economic recovery is highly uncertain.  The evolution of the Covid-19 crisis would depend on three factors: How the virus progresses in terms of the development of a vaccine and the impact on a country’s healthcare system The spillover effects on the economy How the pandemic affects consumer behaviours, as well as a country’s macro-policy responses  REASONS FOR DROP IN RETURNS Mr Lim said that the drop in the returns this time is mainly because the financial year ending March 2000 was excluded from the 20-year assessment period, and less so because of the inclusion of Financial Year 2019/20.  Global markets were doing very well during FY1999/2000 due to the technology bubble.  Dr Jeffrey Jaensubhakij, GIC’s group chief investment officer, said that GIC already started taking a more defensive stance in investment decisions going into the previous financial year due to the high valuations in the market.  The sovereign wealth fund manages most of the Government’s financial assets and invests in a wide range of assets. Besides investing in companies that had a stable income coming in, Dr Jaensubhakij said that GIC also sold some of its assets that had become too expensive and turned the money into dry powder or cash reserves. Compared with the previous financial year, GIC has increased its portfolio share in nominal bonds and cash in this latest one ending in March 2020 and reduced the proportion invested in equities in developed and emerging markets due to the higher risks in these asset classes.  As for whether this downward trend will continue in the future, Dr Jaensubhakij said that most of the 20 years after the turn of the century was a “very poor period for global equity”.  With high valuations still an issue in the future, he said that it will still be a “tough environment” ahead.  SHIFT IN INVESTMENT APPROACH Due to an uncertain future and the issue of high valuations in some asset classes such as bonds, Mr Lim said that there will be greater divergence across countries, sectors and companies.  “In terms of investment approach, we have to go deeper, we have to be more bottom-up, we have to go earlier in our investment value chain… (unlike) in the past where you could enjoy kind of a passive approach in asset allocation in particular,” he said in response to questions from the media.  He added that the “bottom-up” approach has been the strategy that GIC has taken in the last few years. This includes working more closely with entrepreneurs and companies, funding them at a very early stage and connecting them with GIC’s networks.  Amplitude, a cloud startup that tracks online behaviours, as well as food-technology startup Apeel Sciences, are two examples of enterprises that GIC invested in the early stages of their growth.  AVAILABLE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES With the global economy focused on fighting Covid-19, Mr Lim said that healthcare and technology have emerged as the clear sector winners among investors.  However, he said that there are opportunities in other industries because the costs of investing in those sectors have gone down due to the pandemic.  Some examples include the consumer and infrastructure sectors that could make a comeback in a post-Covid-19 world, especially companies that are able to respond to change and have sufficient balance sheets.  Dr Jaensubhakij also said that data centres and logistics are another two sectors that are worth looking into due to changes brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.  However, he said that the GIC team has to be careful when assessing these companies even though their valuations have gone down.  There are those that may never make a comeback after Covid-19, while others may recover three years from now.

[2020-07-28 16:58:57.774426] INFO NewsParser:222: content :   SINGAPORE — Fresh from a bruising General Election (GE) which saw the ruling People’s Action Party retain a super majority but cede more parliamentary seats to the opposition, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday (July 27) urged Singaporeans to unite and focus their energies on the major challenges presented by the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. Nevertheless, he noted that the “strong desire” from Singaporeans for a greater diversity of views in politics and for more robust debate of policies and plans is “here to stay”, and that the political system will need to evolve to accommodate it, he said at the swearing-in ceremony of the new Cabinet. “Whatever our political persuasions, never forget that we are first and foremost Singaporeans,” PM Lee said in a televised speech from the Istana. The downsized ceremony held in the midst of a pandemic was attended by about 200 invited guests — all wearing masks and seated a distance apart — including senior civil servants, foreign diplomats and newly elected Members of Parliament (MPs), split between two venues: The Istana and the Parliament House.

New officeholders will also bring fresh ideas and perspectives, he added. There were seven new political appointments, of which six were debutants in GE2020. Among them is Dr Tan See Leng, who now takes on three ministerial roles, as being Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and Second Minister for Manpower and for Trade and Industry.

While the Government will formally designate Workers’ Party (WP) chief Pritam Singh as the Leader of the Opposition, PM Lee reiterated his hope that the nine other newly elected WP MPs and the two Non-Constituency MPs from the Progress Singapore Party will play their role of a “responsible and loyal opposition”. “Their duty is not merely to raise criticisms and ask questions of the Government, necessary as these functions are, but also, more importantly, to put forward serious policy alternatives to be scrutinised and debated,” he said. PM Lee with Workers' Party Chief Pritam Singh at the Istana on Monday (July 27). Photo: Ministry of Communications and Information The immediate duty of the Government will be to tackle the public health threat of Covid-19, as cities such as Hong Kong and Seoul, which initially brought the virus under control, have suffered repeat outbreaks after reopening their economies, he said. He added that Singapore also faces the enormous task of getting the economy running again, after it shrank a record 12.6 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter this year. Noting that the four national Budgets this year have staved off the worst of the damage, he said: “Economic conditions will continue to be difficult and we must expect to lose many more jobs. We will do our best to save as many as we can and help workers who still lose their jobs to find new work.” The Government is committed to help businesses hard hit by Covid-19, such as those in the construction, tourism and aviation sectors, he added. But it cannot afford to prop up failing industries indefinitely or trap workers in jobs that are no longer viable. That is why, he said, the better solution is for the Government to redouble efforts to invest in new capabilities, grow new industries and help workers reskill for the new jobs that will be created. Beyond the crisis, the Government must also fulfil the broader ambitions that Singaporeans have for the country, he said. “We aspire to be a fair and just society, with opportunities for all. We wish to fashion an inclusive community, where we look out for one another, reach out to those who need help, and show every Singaporean that they have a stake in our future," he said. “We want to make this a home where Singaporeans always believe their children will have better lives than themselves, and the human spirit can flourish. This is the nation we are building together.”

[2020-07-28 17:02:15.855253] INFO NewsParser:222: content : SINGAPORE — Local tours run by operators and tourist guides can now have bigger groups, as long as safe distancing measures are in place between sub-groups of participants, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said on Tuesday (July 28). Tours involving transport such as buses can take up to 50 people or at the vehicle's maximum operating capacity after implementation of safe management measures, whichever is lower. Local walking, cycling and kayaking tours are limited to a maximum of 10 people excluding the tour guide. All tours have to ensure that there are not more than five people in a sub-group. At least 1m distance has to be maintained between the sub-groups and there should be no intermingling. Tours also cannot exceed eight hours, STB said. The easing of guidelines comes after the launch of a S$45 million tourism campaign urging locals to explore Singapore, with packages and promotions on offer.

[2020-07-28 17:05:07.491532] INFO NewsParser:222: content :   SINGAPORE — Four egg wholesalers accounting for about 30 per cent Singapore’s total egg supply were blocked from importing from Malaysia from July 20, after failing to meet a licensing requirement. The authorities had imposed the requirement in a bid to improve the diversification of egg supply. However, there is no need to “hoard or panic-buy”, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said, because 32 other egg importers can continue to import as usual and Singapore farms produced 26 per cent of the country's egg supply last year. “There is adequate supply of eggs to meet the usual demand from consumers as the majority of egg importers can continue to import as usual. We are monitoring the market closely.”  The authorities introduced a new licensing regime in April last year that required importers to come up with business continuity plans (BCPs). Read also: New Zealand sends first batch of essential supplies to Singapore, as part of pact to keep trade flowing amid Covid-19 SFA said that this was necessary to improve the resilience of Singapore’s egg supply and of the industry, because “over 70 per cent of our eggs” came from a single source. Procuring eggs from a diversified range of sources is one of the strategies that importers can adopt as part of their BCPs, SFA said. Other strategies include establishing retainer contracts with alternate sources or keeping a buffer stock. One option is to import some of their eggs from other countries besides their dominant source, which is what many importers chose to do.  Read also: The Big Read: Global supply chain shock has farmers dumping food as consumers fret over shortages, price hikes   TODAY understands that most importers who managed to get BCP approvals are importing at least 15 per cent of their eggs from other sources besides their dominant source. TODAY has also learnt that the importers that did not manage to meet their BCP targets are Ming Kee Egg Supplies, Hup Seng Fresh Eggs Supplier, Premium Egg Products and Green-Tech Egg Industries. Without naming these parties, SFA told TODAY that the four importers “made limited effort and progress” in fulfilling their BCPs and so, it will no longer approve their permits for egg imports from their dominant source. Read also: New S$30m grant to help local farmers ramp up food production in next 6 to 24 months  “They will need to redouble their efforts to comply with their BCPs, and SFA will approve permits for imports from their dominant source as soon as they comply,” it added. In the meantime, these firms are still allowed to continue importing from other accredited sources, it stated, pointing out that the number of approved countries and farms for eggs has increased from 47 farms in seven countries in 2016 to 121 farms in 13 countries as of July 9. ‘TOO MANY ISSUES’ WITH NEW EGG SOURCES Read also: The Big Read: Singapore has been buttressing its food security for decades. Now, people realise why The affected importers, however, said that they failed to meet their targets for good reason. Mr Bernard Ghoh, director of Hup Seng, said that his firm supplies solely to hawkers, most of whom do not have facilities to keep their eggs chilled, but eggs imported from countries farther than Malaysia require refrigeration. “If I give them chilled eggs, the difficulty they will face is that they will have to store it at room temperature since they don't have cold places to keep those eggs,” the 53-year-old added. “After three to four days, the eggs will turn mouldy and they will start complaining.” As a result, Hup Seng managed to import just 5 per cent of its eggs from its other source countries, Thailand and Ukraine. Mr Marcus Seah, 25, a marketing manager at his family business, Ming Kee, said that the need to refrigerate the eggs constituted an extra business cost. Importers have to either invest hundreds of thousands in building a cold room or rent such facilities. Mr Seah said that another issue is with the fluctuating demand brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes it easier to rely on Malaysia where orders can be fulfilled in a day. Ming Kee’s other source countries require a lead time of about 35 days for Ukraine and seven to 10 days for Thailand before an order could be fulfilled, Mr Seah said. Ming Kee also has had issues with farms in alternative source countries where they do not have a long-standing relationship. Mr Seah mentioned how his Thai supplier cancelled his order of 25 containers of eggs on July 10. Each container carries about 325,000 eggs. “If we have these 25 containers, I will reach my BCP goal of 15 per cent,” he said. All in all, “it is not that we don’t want to fulfil the requirement”, he added. “Overseas, there are too many issues.” A manager of Premium Egg Products who declined to be named said that egg prices are one big factor. Malaysia’s eggs cost about 13 cents each, while farms in Thailand are quoting 14 to 16 cents a piece. Eggs from farms in New Zealand, Japan and Australia cost doubly more, the man in his 50s said. Saying that his firm would have to wind up if it still cannot find a way out in the next six to 12 months, he appealed to the authorities to allow firms to progressively hit their current targets. Mr Ng Kong Guan, 65, owner of Green-Tech, called this a “human-created crisis”, noting that it came in the wake of the economy’s reopening after the circuit breaker curbing business activities from April 7 to June 1. “Now is not the time… (but it appears that) they don’t care about your survival,” he said. LEAD TIME GIVEN TO ADJUST In response to TODAY’s queries on these issues, SFA, a statutory board under the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, reiterated that its import diversification efforts aim to ensure that Singapore is not overly reliant on any particular country. It added: “The BCP implementation will also help cushion the business impact on our egg importers in the event of any supply disruption.” It then said that importers were given “sufficient” lead time of more than a year to adjust and comply with their BCPs, and that a majority of egg importers had managed to meet their BCPs in spite of external circumstances and challenges. The number of hen shell eggs imported from alternative sources such as Poland, Ukraine and Thailand had increased from an average of 1.4 per cent of total imports in 2018 to 14.4 per cent by May this year. SFA added that it understands that importers may face “initial difficulties” in meeting their BCPs and need more time to comply. It had therefore “granted concessions to importers where appropriate”, it said. Those that had shown consistent efforts to diversify and comply with their BCPs were granted a concession, SFA said. The authority had also heard appeals and granted concessions to firms that were able to provide proof that they had been making an effort to comply with their BCPs, it added. As for importers’ concerns on added business costs, SFA said that it will “continue to work with the industry and facilitate access to more price-competitive alternative sources”. “While the Government does our part to facilitate the diversification process, the industry should also be proactive in diversifying egg supply sources and grow more resilient through better business continuity planning,” it added.  As long as the BCPs are “satisfactory”, SFA said that it will grant licences to egg importers. This is not the first time that egg importers have been penalised for failing to comply with their BCPs. Before July 20, SFA had taken action against four other companies. Two of these firms later fulfilled their requirement and were allowed to resume importing from all sources. Mr Aloysius Lee, managing director of Kai Young Huat Trading, said that it was initially tough to set up the facilities and logistics to accommodate importing from alternative sources, but acknowledged that it became more workable over time. His firm subscribes to a BCP of importing 15 per cent of its eggs from sources outside of Malaysia as well. It attained its goal by importing from Ukraine, Poland, Spain and Thailand. The 39-year-old revealed that his firm had spent S$200,000 or more on a chiller to accommodate eggs from the alternative sources. ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY YEO JONG HAN
