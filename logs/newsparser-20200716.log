[2020-07-16 19:05:08.929726] INFO newsparser:232: content :  JAKARTA, KRJOGJA.com – Ketua Badan Amil Zakat Nasional (BAZNAS) Prof. Dr. Bambang Sudibyo MBA.CA mengatakan, sejak Januari – Juni 2020, Organisasi Pengelola Zakat (OPZ) seluruh Indonesia di bawah koordinasi BAZNAS, telah melaksanakan perannya dalam melayani muzaki dan mustahik melalui program-program unggulannya. Pengumpulan zakat nasional pada 2020 ini, menurutnya, ditargetkan sebesar Rp12,48 Triliun atau naik dari tahun lalu sebesar Rp10,22 Triliun. Menghadapi pandemi Covid-19 pada awal tahun ini, BAZNAS dan LAZ di 31 provinsi telah menyalurkan Rp296,07 Miliar. “Dan masyarakat terdampak Covid-19 mendapatkan manfaat zakat melalui program darurat kesehatan dan program darurat sosial ekonomi,” katanya di Jakarta, Kamis (16/7/2020). Sebelumnya BAZNAS memaparkan laporan pengelolaan zakat nasional dalam Rapat Dengar Pendapat (RDP) dengan Komisi VIII DPR RI, Rabu (15/7/2020). Hadir dalam RDP selain Bambang Sudibyo adalah Wakil Ketua BAZNAS, Dr. Zainulbahar Noor, SE, M.Ec , Anggota serta jajaran Direksi BAZNAS. Bambang menyebutkan, laporan pengelolaan zakat kepada DPR ini merupakan bagian dari upaya BAZNAS untuk menjalankan peran sebagai pengelola zakat nasional yang akuntabel. “BAZNAS meningkatkan layanan zakat kepada muzaki dan mustahik melalui pengelolaan zakat yang transparan dan akuntabel. Salah satunya melalui laporan resmi kepada Presiden dan DPR RI,” jelas Bambang.  Selain itu, ia menyampaikan bahwa BAZNAS Pusat pengumpulan ZIS pada Januari hingga Juni 2020 mengalami kenaikan sebesar 46 persen dibandingkan dengan periode yang sama dengan tahun lalu meskipun masyarakat sedang terdampak Covid-19. Kenaikan ini dikarenakan kesiapan BAZNAS dalam mengantisipasi pengumpulan melalui digital. Pendistribusian dan Pendayagunaan di era Covid-19 mengalami kenaikan sebesar 129,82 persen dari sisi jumlah dana tersalurkan, dan 87,42 persen dari sisi jumlah mustahik dibandingkan dengan periode yang sama dengan tahun lalu. Anggaran APBN sebesar Rp 8 Miliar digunakan untuk Covid-19 sebesar Rp724.690.000, sehingga total nett anggaran APBN adalah Rp7.275.310.000. Realisasi APBN digunakan untuk kebutuhan rutin operasional sebesar 35,2 persen atau Rp 2.563.895.551 selama Januari-Juni 2020. “Penyerapan anggaran APBN belum optimal disebabkan oleh adanya kebijakan Bekerja Dari Rumah (BDR) yang mengakibatkan pengurangan biaya operasional termasuk tidak adanya biaya perjalanan dinas,” tandas Bambang.

Hal ini diceritakan oleh guru Seni Budaya SMPN 15 Yogyakarta Ani Rahmawati SPd, Kamis (16/7/20). “Terlebih dahulu guru menyampaikan tema, kemudian siswa mendapat kebebasan untuk mengeksplore tema dari guru, ” kata Ani. Siswa mengerjakan dan menyelesaikan tugas pada jam matapelajaran itu juga. Biasanya kendala adalah pada kuota internet siswa ketika akan mengirimkan video tugasnya kepada guru. Menurut Ani Rahmawati karena pelajaran seni budaya itu 75% praktik sebetulnya lebih sempurna kalau pelajaran dengan tatap muka. Akan tetapi karena kondisi pandemi maka Ani Rahmawati berusaha agar pelajaran seni budaya menjadi kegiatan menyenangkan bagi siswa, meskipun lewat daring.  “Itu yang sudah dilakukan tahun pelajaran yang lalu dan akan diterapkan pada tahun pelajaran 2020/2021. Untuk pelajaran tari sebelum menggunakan iringan musik terlebih dahulu menggunakan hitungan.

Tidak membedakan kaya dan miskin dalam memberikan layanan, apalagi sampai meminta jasa, karena kita sebagai ASN sudah dibayar rakyat melalui pajak, ASN harus memberikan layanan dengan kualitas yang baik dan memiliki akuntabilitas yang tinggi sesuai dengan aturan yang berlaku. Nizam mengingatkan ASN harus berani atau menjadi pelopor dalam memberantas korupsi di dunia pendidikan. ASN yang bekerja di dunia pendidikan harus memberi contoh yang baik pada peserta didik. “Tanggung jawab kita untuk menjadi yang terdepan menjadi teladan, dan di dalam menjauhkan dari korupsi,” imbuh dia. Nizam mengatakan nilai kerugian negara yang ditimbulkan akibat korupsi mencapai Rp8,4 triliun sepanjang 2019. Selain itu, setiap tahunnya ribuan ASN dipecat karena korupsi.  Indeks perilaku antikorupsi Indonesia sepanjang 2012 hingga 2020, semakin meningkat dari 3,55 menjadi 3,80. Di Asia Tenggara, Indonesia menempati posisi keempat setelah Singapura, Brunei Darussalam, dan Malaysia untuk perilaku antikorupsi. Dia menambahkan Ditjen Dikti siap mendukung sistem integrasi nasional. Dengan tidak adanya korupsi maka pembangunan akan lancar dan uang rakyat akan lebih banyak dimanfaatkan untuk pembangunan, tatanan hukum menjadi lebih baik lagi, dan kualitas hidup meningkat. “Karena korupsi itu penyakit, maka melalui tiga aspek yakni promotif, preventif, dan kuratif. Sejumlah upaya kam lakukan untuk promotif misalnya dengan kebijakan SIGAP melayani, sistem pembayaran nontunai, model agen perubahan, sosialisasi, dan lainnya,” kata dia lagi. Dikti juga mendorong agar ASN mengisi Laporan Harta Kekayaan Aparatur Sipil Negara (LHKASN) dan Laporan Harta Kekayaan Penyelenggara Negara (LHKPN). ASN yang terbukti melakukan tindak pidana korupsi akan mendapatkan sanksi tegas. ASN, kata dia, dapat diberhentikan jika dihukum penjara atau kurungan berdasarkan putusan pengadilan yang telah memiliki kekuatan hukum tetap. Karena itu, penting bagi ASN menjaga integritas dirinya agar tidak terlibat dalam praktik korupsi.(ati)

[2020-07-16 19:10:45.998410] INFO newsparser:232: content :  BANTUL, KRJOGJA.com – Pasar Bantengan Wonocatur Banguntapan Bantul, terpaksa ditutup selama tiga hari mulai Kamis hingga Sabtu (16-18/7) untuk dilakukan strilisasi dengan penyemprotan disinfektan, menyusul diketahui hasil Swab test ada seorang pedagang di pasar tersebut positif Covid-19. Sebelumnya, Puskesmas Banguntapan II juga dilakukan disinfektasi selama 2 hari, pada Selasa hingga Rabu (14-15/7) karena kasus yang sama, ditemukan petugas kesehatan positif Covid-19. Sedangkan Puskesmas Banguntapan I mengalami kasus yang sama sudah menjalani stririlisasi pekan lalu. Kepala Dinas Kesehatan Bantul, Agus Budi Raharjo didampingi Juru Bicara Gugus Tugas Percepatan Covid-19 Bantul, dr Sri Wahyu Joko Santoso mengemukakan, sesuai kebijakan nasional, gugus tugas harus meningkatkan tracking (pelacakan), tracing (penelusuran) dan testing (pengujian). “Untuk itu perlu dilakukan secara masif, rapid test untuk skrining dan kepentingan epidemiologi Swab test “polymerase chain reaction” (PCR) untuk penegakan diagnosis dan mengetahui pasien positif sejak dini,” ungkapnya.  Diketahuinya terdapat pedagang pasar maupun petugas kesehatan yang positif Covid-19 karena Gugus Tugas Percepatan Covid-19 Bantul memang menggalakkan kegiatan tracking, tracing dan testing di tempat-tempat rawan penularan Covid-19, seperti di pasar dan para petugas kesehatan. “Sehingga logis jika di Bantul pada akhir-akhir angka positif Covid- 19 agak melonjak dan masyarakat tidak perlu takut, tetapi tetap wajib mentaati protokoler kesehatan,” tambahnya. Jika tidak digalakkan tracking, tracing dan testing, kemungkinan angka positif Covid-19 di Bantul tidak kelihatan atau menurun, walaupun sebenarnya banyak warga yang positif Covid-19. Tetapi hal tersebut bisa menjadi bom waktu dan sewaktu-waktu bisa meledak penularan Covid-19 tidak terkendali. Maka lebih baik diketahui lebih dini dan pengobatan secepatnya dengan menggalakkan tracking, tracing dan testing. (Jdm/Roy)

Untuk memudahkan pendataan pemilik kendaraan yang nunggak pajak, pihak Samsat Bantul menggandeng Capat dan Pamong Desa melakukan sosialiasi dan penyampaian informasi ke wajib pajak. Menurut Kepala Samsat Bantul, Pramono didampingi Kasi Pendataan Samsat Bantul, Winardi, dari 15.000 unit kendaraan yang nunggak pajak tersebut, sekitar 25-27 persen masih berada di tangan pemilik, selebihnya sudah ada yang dijual, rusak, ditarik dealer, pindah alamat, hilang dan lainnya. Sehingga untuk mencari alamat pemilik, pihak Samsat melibatkan Camat dan Pamong Desa untuk membantu pendataan kendaraan atau pemilik kendaraan yang nunggak pajak.”Karena itu, petugas Samsat Bantul dalam beberapa hari terakhir ini menggalakkan sosialisasi pendataan di kecamatan masing-masing,” jelas Pramono. Selain sosialisasi pendataan, juga disosialisasikan Pergub DIY Nomor 26/2020 dan Pergub DIY No 42/2020 , tentang penghapusan denda pajak kendaraan yang dimulai Juni hingga 30 Juli 2020 dan diperpanjang mulai 1 Agustus hingga 30 September 2020. “Tetapi Pergub DIY tersebut hanya menghapus dendanya saja bukan membebaskan pajak kendaraan, karena ada yang salah persepsi mengira kendaraannya dibebaskan dari pajak,” ungkap Pramono.  Sementara, selama pandemi Covid-19, angka penambahan kendaraan bermotor, jenis mobil maupun sepeda motor mengalami penurunan drastis. Sebelum pandemi Covid-19, penambahan kendaraan per hari rata-rata bisa mencapai 125 unit, tetapi selama pandemi Covid-19 rata-rata per hari hanya 15 unit. Dengan penurunan penambahan kendaraan tersebut, pada tahun 2020 ini terget pemasukan pajak kendaraan bermotor dipastikan akan menurun tajam, bahkan mungkin hanya akan tercapai 20 persen dari target setiap tahun. Kepala Samsat Bantul juga berharap, untuk menjaga jarak atau wajib protokoler kesehatan dalam upaya mencegah penularan Covid-19, para wajib bisa memanfaatkan program pembayaran pajak lewat Samsat Online Nasional dan pembayaran pajak kendaraan lewat ATM BPD.(Jdm)

Pengasuh Pondok Pesantren Miftahul Jannah, Jambu Kabupaten, yang juga pengusaha kaligrafi bahan tembaga itu lepas dari jeratan hukum. “Kita hentikan karena berdasarkan penelusuran, tidak cukup bukti soal kasus Syekh Puji”,ungkap Kasubdit IV Renakta Ditreskrimum AKBP Sunarno pada gelar kasus, Kamis (16/7) di Mapolda Jateng, Semarang. Sebaliknya Ny En, ibu dari gadis cilik berusia 7 tahun terkait berita yang dianggap memojokkanjustru meminta perlindungan ke Polda Jateng. Sebelum kasus Syeh Puji, yang pernah tersandung kasus serupa hingga mendekam di tahanan bermula dari laporan Endar Susilo selaku ketua Komnas Anak Provinsi Jawa Tengah. Dalam laporan adanya dugaan persetubuhan dan pencabulan terhadap anak dibawah umur yang dilakukan oleh SyehPuji pada 5 Desember 2019 lalu. Dari laporan yang menyebutkan Syeh Puji menikah siri yang kedua kali dengan gadis cilik segera menyebar. Penyidik subdit IV remaja anak dan wanita( Renakta) Ditreskrimum segera bertindak dengan mengumpulkan barang bukti dan saksi.  Sedikitnya ada 18 saksi,termasuk dua saksi ahli dari Kantor Pengadilan Agama dan dokter yang memvisum gadis cilik itu. Namun, dalam perkembangan penyelidikan hanya satu orang yang menyatakan telah terjadi pernikahan Syekh Puji dengan bocah berusia 7 tahun warga Grabag.”Saksi-saki yang diajukan oleh pelapor cuma satu yang bicara soal pernikahan Syekh Puji dengan bocah 7 tahun tersebut. Satu saksi itu Apri, yang juga keponakan Syeh Puji. Lainnya mengaku tidak tahu”, jelasnya Disebutkan berdasarkan pemeriksaan alat bukti hasil rekaman pelapor ketua KPA Jateng Endar Susilo dengan orang tua korban tidak ada yang menyatakan jika anaknya dengan Syekh Puji telah melakukan nikah siri.
Selain itu pihaknya juga tidak menemukan bukti kongkrit maupun fakta hukum yang menjelaskan sesuai keterangan saksi ahli dari dokter tidak terjadi kekerasan seksual kepada bocah 7 tahun tersebut. Sebaliknya dari hasil penelusuran saksi-saki yang diberikan pelapor hanya semacam testimoni-testimoni saja. Bukti testimoni tersebut dapat diketahui dari hasil rekaman yang tersimpan pada flash disk.

Karena tiga bulan ke depan masih menerima, maka datanya harus valid. Tidak boleh lagi ada penerima yang mendapatkan dobel BLTDD dan BST. Harus salah satu saja. Maka, kami meminta pemerintah desa membentuk desk khusus. Di dalamnya melibatkan orang-orag yang benar-benar paham kondisi warga,” katanya kepada wartawan usai menyerahkan secara simbolis BLTDD tahap II jatah Juli 2020 di aula Kecamatan Jumantono, Rabu (15/7).  Dalam penyaluran kali ini, total anggaran Rp 8.158.200.000. Adapun penerima BLTDD Agustus-Oktober 2020 ditentukan melalui musyawarah desa khusus. Sangat dimungkinkan penerimanya berlainan dari tahap II. Babinsa dan Babinkamtibmas desa ikut memberi masukan tentang kondisi riil warga calon penerima bantuan. “Yang tahu persis warga itu selain perangkat desa, adalah babinsa dab babinkamtibmas. Bisa jadi seorang kadus malah enggak paham warganya,” katanya. Sementara itu pencairan BLT DD tahap II jatah bulan Juli dilaksanakan serentak yang dipusatkan di kantor kecamatan Jumantono, Mojogedang, Matesih, Jumaplo dan Jatiyoso. Sedangkan 12 kecamatan lainnya disalurkan ke masing-masing desa. Bank Jateng selaku operator pendistribusian menyerahkannya secara cash and carry. Per penerima berhak Rp 600 ribu. Sedangkan untuk Agustus-Oktober, per penerima berhak Rp 300 ribu. Perpanjangannya sesuai Peraturan Menteri Desa PDTT Nomor 7 tahun 2020 tentang Perubahan Kedua atas Permendesa PDTT Nomor 11 Tahun 2019 tentan Prioritas Penggunaan Dana Desa tahun 2020. (Lim)

Hadirnya aplikasi e-Dabu Mobile ini diharapkan membuat badan usaha lebih cepat dan lebih praktis dalam melakukan proses pengecekan data peserta maupun perubahan data JKN-KIS para pekerjanya. “Melalui pengembangan ini, kami ingin memberikan kemudahan, kecepatan, dan kepastian informasi kepada badan usaha, khususnya bagi mereka yang menjadi Person In Charge (PIC) di masing-masing perusahaan, guna memperoleh informasi terkait pegawai dan anggota keluarganya yang telah terdaftar JKN-KIS,” jelas Direktur Utama BPJS Kesehatan Fachmi Idris dalam acara Gathering Badan Usaha di BPJS Kesehatan Kantor Pusat, Kamis (16/07). Berbeda dengan aplikasi e-Dabu yang selama ini harus diakses melalui laptop atau personal computer (PC), aplikasi e-Dabu Mobile dapat diakses dengan mudah oleh PIC badan usaha kapan dan di mana saja melalui smartphone. Di samping itu, aplikasi yang bisa diunduh melalui Playstore ini juga telah dilengkapi dengan fitur untuk mengecek status kepesertaan JKN-KIS pekerja dan anggota keluarganya, riwayat pembayaran iuran, data mutasi pekerja, tren pembayaran, hingga konten kesehatan.  Pada kesempatan tersebut, Fachmi juga memberikan apresiasi kepada sejumlah Badan Usaha Milik Negara (BUMN) dan badan usaha swasta yang berperan besar mendukung implementasi Program JKN-KIS dengan patuh mendaftarkan pekerja dan anggota keluarganya, menyampaikan data pekerja yang valid, dan disiplin membayar iuran. “Program JKN-KIS memiliki konsep protection, sharing, dan compliance. Artinya, kita semua harus berperan aktif melindungi diri sendiri dan keluarga (protection), berbagi dengan sesama dalam skema gotong royong yang merupakan budaya Indonesia (sharing) serta patuh sebagai warga negara dengan menjadi peserta Program JKN-KIS (compliance). Keberadaan badan usaha sendiri diharapkan bisa menjadi role model atau motor penggerak bagi masyarakat untuk berpartisipasi aktif mendukung Program JKN-KIS,” ujar Fachmi.(ati)

During this period, the daily temperature is forecast to range between 24°C and 33°C. While showers are expected over many days, the daily temperature could still reach a high of about 34°C for a day or two. “Lows of around 22°C can be expected on a few rainy days,” said the national weather service.

[2020-07-16 19:22:08.551695] INFO newsparser:236: content :   SINGAPORE — Individuals and firms which won the right to defer repaying their loans need not repay the full sum when these relief measures end on Dec 31 this year, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) managing director Ravi Menon said on Thursday (July 16). At a media conference held via teleconferencing platform Zoom, Mr Menon said that details of schemes for people to resume loan repayments gradually are being worked out with financial institutions and are set to be unveiled in October, so as to give them time to adjust. “We can't have a ‘cliff effect’. It can't be that midnight Dec 31, all the reliefs stop and then people have to start making repayments (on) Jan 1, (2021). That will be too sudden and many people may not be prepared,” said Mr Menon. “On the other hand, we can't indefinitely extend the moratorium. Because there is growing risk and it's not without cost.” In March, MAS announced a set of relief measures for those facing cash flow problems as the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic took its toll on Singapore businesses, mortgage holders and others. Read also: Covid-19: Individuals, SMEs to get relief from loan repayments, debt and insurance premiums  Individuals have been able to apply to defer their mortgage loan repayments till the end of the year. They can also defer paying premiums for life and insurance policies by up to six months, or arrange for a flexible instalment plan for general insurance policies. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) have also been able to apply for this relief for secured loans or to apply for loans with lower interest rates. Giving an update on these uptake of these relief measures at the release of MAS’ annual report, Mr Menon said nearly 34,000 individuals have successfully applied to defer the payment of their principal or interest of their mortgage loans. Read also: Repayment for renovation, education and car loans can be deferred from May 6: MAS More than 25,000 have also deferred paying their insurance premiums for six months. As for SMEs, more than 5,300 have also applied for repayment deferment. “When you defer repayment you are actually increasing the amount of outstanding debt at the end of the deferment period… And so our hope is that the economic situation improves to the point where they can start making some repayments, not all, but it can't be zero,” he said. Read also: Global economic situation remains dire, substantial uncertainty ahead: MAS chief Ravi Menon There are also wider macro-economic implications if these relief measures are extended indefinitely. The more debt one accumulates, the more defaults will rise and this will be considered as a non-performing loan in the banks’ balance sheet, which will eat into their capital, limiting their ability to lend more money, he noted. Mr Menon added that the MAS is holding discussions with banks and other financial institutions on how to ease borrowers and policyholders into gradually resuming repayments once the measures expire. “We'll have to consider the economic situation closer to the end of the year, we will have to look at doing a deep analysis with the banks on those borrowers who have chosen to defer, what are their conditions like, (what their) financial situation (is) like and what kind of repayment can they possibly stomach,” he said. “The pace of resuming repayments needs to balance between two things: The cash flow situation of the borrowers and the accumulation of more debt which could increase the risk of default further down the road.” When asked for further information on how the repayment arrangements would look once they resume, Mr Menon said it is premature to elaborate, except to say that there will be “a whole range of options”. “It will differ by type of borrower. We could have a different approach towards mortgages, we could have a different approach towards SME loans, towards secured loans versus (unsecured) loans,” he said. Factors to be considered, in the case of a mortgage loan, for example, would be the size of a person’s loan relative to the value of his or her property. For SMEs, their cash flow would be one aspect to consider when assessing the extent to which they can start making repayments. “We have to make a policy that is across the board which also means it may not meet the needs of every single borrower. So we'll have to allow some discretion and the banks will have to exercise discretion as to where they may depart from the baseline that we agree upon so as to accommodate individual borrowers’ circumstances,” he said. Mr Menon also said that devising the relief measures took just two weeks of discussions but withdrawing them is “much more complex and complicated”, and was a matter which would require months of discussions. “When we implemented the measures we didn't have to do any study. We just did it because we knew it was going to be necessary for a significant number of people… But now when you want to withdraw you need to really understand the individual situation,” he said. When asked whether the number of people and companies applying for these relief measures was a cause of concern, Mr Menon said that the numbers are not unduly large relative to the total size of the mortgage market or the total size of SME loan portfolio. “(This) suggests that people know they can have these deferments but not everyone has rushed in, which is a good sign, because one of our initial fears was what if the majority of people opt for these deferments then they would just be building up debt for no good reason,” he said. He added that the approval rate of these applications is between 90 and 95 per cent. “Now we are monitoring their financial conditions and getting an update to see if indeed this is a problem. But I think the numbers on their own do not suggest to me that this is something alarming,” he said. Besides these relief measures from MAS, the Government has also passed a temporary law which allows individuals and businesses to get some relief from their contractual obligations for as long as six months. The aim of this law is to give “breathing space” and “staunch the flow of blood” for those struggling over since the deadly coronavirus reached Singapore’s shores, said Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam during the Parliamentary debate on the temporary legislation in April. The six broad categories of contracts covered are: Leases and licences of non-residential property Construction-related contracts Event and tourism-related contracts Hire-purchase or conditional sales agreements Certain types of loans for SMEs Option-to-purchase or sales and purchase agreements for residential properties The law also includes a rental relief framework that compels landlords to waive up to two months of base rent for eligible SMEs that have suffered significant losses owing to Covid-19.

[2020-07-16 19:23:09.201936] INFO newsparser:236: content : SINGAPORE — The Singapore Zoo recently welcomed the birth of twin red ruffed lemurs, a critically endangered species whose reproduction is known to be "notoriously difficult", the Wildlife Reserves Singapore said on Thursday (July 16). This is the first time the red ruffled lemur has been born here since the birth of the twins' father Bosco more than a decade ago. The twins were born on Feb 22 "while the Covid-19 pandemic swept across the world", said WRS. The baby lemurs are now almost five months old and have begun to welcome visitors, following the zoo's reopening on July 6. The twin's mother is Minnie, an eight-year-old brought to Singapore in 2016 from Yokohama Zoo in Japan. 
This undated handout photo from Wildlife Reserves Singapore released on July 16, 2020 shows a nurse place microchip on one of the twin red-ruffed lemur babies during its first health check up at the animal hospital for Singapore Zoo. Photo: Wildlife Reserves Singapore via AFP Her move to the country was planned and coordinated as part of an ex-situ conservation programme under the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria. "The couple was specially matched because of their genetic compatibility... as part of ongoing conservation breeding efforts between zoological institutions to protect wildlife and biodiversity," said WRS in a media release. "Reproduction for these rust-coloured primates is notoriously difficult as they only breed once a year. "On top of this, females are only fertile for one out of the few days they are sexually receptive, making this twin birth particularly special," WRS added.  Red ruffed lemurs are classified as critically endangered under the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. The main threats to them are habitat loss due to illegal logging and hunting. They live together as a family and so are often hunted in groups. Native to northeastern Madagascar, the red ruffed lemur is a sister species to the black and white ruffed lemurs. Even though the two species do not coexist in the same geographical range, they are able to understand each other’s calls and communicate. CNA For more stories like this, visit cna.asia.

[2020-07-16 19:23:43.179127] INFO newsparser:236: content : NEW YORK/SINGAPORE — Car alarms, jackhammers, a drunken argument and the rumble of the No 7 train in New York passing overhead. It is the glorious urban symphony that pours into a typical New York City apartment building day and night. Sure, closing the window can help, but there goes your natural ventilation. What if there were technology to cancel the offending clamor, like a pair of giant noise-canceling headphones for your apartment? Researchers in Singapore have developed an apparatus that can be placed in a window to reduce incoming sound by 10 decibels. The system was created by a team of scientists, including Dr Masaharu Nishimura, who came up with the basic concept, and Dr Bhan Lam, a researcher at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore (NTU). “I grew up in Singapore,” Dr Lam said in a Zoom interview from his apartment there. “It’s a small city with a lot of noise, so I have some motivation to solve this problem.” Their results were published Thursday (July 9) in Scientific Reports. The prototype is not yet the most practical device in real-world conditions, but it points the way toward the development of technologies that may help ease the strain of noisy city living. Read also: Underground silencers cut noise from tunnel ventilation fans at night: SMRT Borrowing from the same technological principles used in noise-canceling headphones, the team expanded the concept to fit an entire room by placing 24 small speakers in a window. The speakers emit sound waves that correspond to the incoming racket and neutralize it — or at least some of it. The system is based on the frequency of the sound waves, and for now, the optimal range is between 300 and 1,000 hz. In Singapore, a city near the equator where temperatures are often high, overlapping transportation systems and the desire for natural ventilation in modern high-rise apartment towers can pose a healthy-living conundrum. Read also: SMRT should reduce noise from overnight work at Tanjong Pagar MRT Station Dr Lam explained that “in places like Singapore, we want to keep the windows open as much as possible” to reduce the use of carbon-intensive air conditioners and to prevent buildup of stale air that can pose health risks for some people. But with windows open, the constant din from city traffic, trains, jets passing overhead and construction equipment can rattle apartments. The Anti-Noise Control Window, as it is called, is the sonic equivalent of shutting a window. With any sound, the best way to reduce it is at the source, like a gun’s silencer. So the researchers treated the window aperture itself as the noise source because most noise enters a room that way. The system uses a microphone outside the window to detect the repeating sound waves of the offending noise source, which is registered by a computer controller. That in turn deciphers the proper wave frequency needed to neutralise the sound, which is transmitted to the array of speakers on the inside of the window frame. The speakers then emit the proper “anti” waves, which cancel out the incoming waves, and there you have it: Near blissful silence. “If you sit in the room, you get that same feeling like when you flick on the switch of noise-canceling earphones,” Dr Lam said, splaying his hands to denote the calming effect. The system is best at attenuating the audible blasts from the types of steady noise sources found within the optimal frequency range. Unfortunately, human voices do not fit within most of that range. One of the next hurdles will be to find a way to silence loud conversations from across the way. Another limitation is that the system is not good at neutralizing sporadic noises, like firecrackers, car horns or the occasional earsplitting crash of metal storefront shutters — the kinds of noises that drive many New Yorkers to slam their windows shut. One reason for the limitation on frequency is the size of the speakers. To cancel out lower frequencies would require larger bass speakers. But those would interfere with ventilation and your ability to see through the window. It’s a trade-off, and one solution might be installing larger windows, or discovering a way to make it work with smaller speakers. As it is, the 24 speakers, each about 2 inches in diameter, are a bit of an aesthetic hindrance. “One complaint that we get is that it’s ugly,” Dr Lam said. But if it can neutralise the sound of the jet taking off from runway 13 at LaGuardia, that is (soft) music to the ears. THE NEW YORK TIMES

[2020-07-16 19:28:15.709952] INFO newsparser:237: content :   SINGAPORE — Individuals and firms which won the right to defer repaying their loans need not repay the full sum when these relief measures end on Dec 31 this year, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) managing director Ravi Menon said on Thursday (July 16). At a media conference held via teleconferencing platform Zoom, Mr Menon said that details of schemes for people to resume loan repayments gradually are being worked out with financial institutions and are set to be unveiled in October, so as to give them time to adjust. “We can't have a ‘cliff effect’. It can't be that midnight Dec 31, all the reliefs stop and then people have to start making repayments (on) Jan 1, (2021). That will be too sudden and many people may not be prepared,” said Mr Menon. “On the other hand, we can't indefinitely extend the moratorium. Because there is growing risk and it's not without cost.” In March, MAS announced a set of relief measures for those facing cash flow problems as the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic took its toll on Singapore businesses, mortgage holders and others.

They can also defer paying premiums for life and insurance policies by up to six months, or arrange for a flexible instalment plan for general insurance policies. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) have also been able to apply for this relief for secured loans or to apply for loans with lower interest rates. Giving an update on these uptake of these relief measures at the release of MAS’ annual report, Mr Menon said nearly 34,000 individuals have successfully applied to defer the payment of their principal or interest of their mortgage loans. Read also: Repayment for renovation, education and car loans can be deferred from May 6: MAS More than 25,000 have also deferred paying their insurance premiums for six months. As for SMEs, more than 5,300 have also applied for repayment deferment. “When you defer repayment you are actually increasing the amount of outstanding debt at the end of the deferment period… And so our hope is that the economic situation improves to the point where they can start making some repayments, not all, but it can't be zero,” he said. Read also: Global economic situation remains dire, substantial uncertainty ahead: MAS chief Ravi Menon There are also wider macro-economic implications if these relief measures are extended indefinitely. The more debt one accumulates, the more defaults will rise and this will be considered as a non-performing loan in the banks’ balance sheet, which will eat into their capital, limiting their ability to lend more money, he noted. Mr Menon added that the MAS is holding discussions with banks and other financial institutions on how to ease borrowers and policyholders into gradually resuming repayments once the measures expire. “We'll have to consider the economic situation closer to the end of the year, we will have to look at doing a deep analysis with the banks on those borrowers who have chosen to defer, what are their conditions like, (what their) financial situation (is) like and what kind of repayment can they possibly stomach,” he said. “The pace of resuming repayments needs to balance between two things: The cash flow situation of the borrowers and the accumulation of more debt which could increase the risk of default further down the road.” When asked for further information on how the repayment arrangements would look once they resume, Mr Menon said it is premature to elaborate, except to say that there will be “a whole range of options”. “It will differ by type of borrower. We could have a different approach towards mortgages, we could have a different approach towards SME loans, towards secured loans versus (unsecured) loans,” he said. Factors to be considered, in the case of a mortgage loan, for example, would be the size of a person’s loan relative to the value of his or her property. For SMEs, their cash flow would be one aspect to consider when assessing the extent to which they can start making repayments. “We have to make a policy that is across the board which also means it may not meet the needs of every single borrower. So we'll have to allow some discretion and the banks will have to exercise discretion as to where they may depart from the baseline that we agree upon so as to accommodate individual borrowers’ circumstances,” he said. Mr Menon also said that devising the relief measures took just two weeks of discussions but withdrawing them is “much more complex and complicated”, and was a matter which would require months of discussions. “When we implemented the measures we didn't have to do any study. We just did it because we knew it was going to be necessary for a significant number of people… But now when you want to withdraw you need to really understand the individual situation,” he said. When asked whether the number of people and companies applying for these relief measures was a cause of concern, Mr Menon said that the numbers are not unduly large relative to the total size of the mortgage market or the total size of SME loan portfolio. “(This) suggests that people know they can have these deferments but not everyone has rushed in, which is a good sign, because one of our initial fears was what if the majority of people opt for these deferments then they would just be building up debt for no good reason,” he said. He added that the approval rate of these applications is between 90 and 95 per cent. “Now we are monitoring their financial conditions and getting an update to see if indeed this is a problem. But I think the numbers on their own do not suggest to me that this is something alarming,” he said. Besides these relief measures from MAS, the Government has also passed a temporary law which allows individuals and businesses to get some relief from their contractual obligations for as long as six months. The aim of this law is to give “breathing space” and “staunch the flow of blood” for those struggling over since the deadly coronavirus reached Singapore’s shores, said Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam during the Parliamentary debate on the temporary legislation in April. The six broad categories of contracts covered are: Leases and licences of non-residential property Construction-related contracts Event and tourism-related contracts Hire-purchase or conditional sales agreements Certain types of loans for SMEs Option-to-purchase or sales and purchase agreements for residential properties The law also includes a rental relief framework that compels landlords to waive up to two months of base rent for eligible SMEs that have suffered significant losses owing to Covid-19.

[2020-07-16 19:28:51.580657] INFO newsparser:237: content : SINGAPORE — The Singapore Zoo recently welcomed the birth of twin red ruffed lemurs, a critically endangered species whose reproduction is known to be "notoriously difficult", the Wildlife Reserves Singapore said on Thursday (July 16). This is the first time the red ruffled lemur has been born here since the birth of the twins' father Bosco more than a decade ago. The twins were born on Feb 22 "while the Covid-19 pandemic swept across the world", said WRS. The baby lemurs are now almost five months old and have begun to welcome visitors, following the zoo's reopening on July 6. The twin's mother is Minnie, an eight-year-old brought to Singapore in 2016 from Yokohama Zoo in Japan. 
This undated handout photo from Wildlife Reserves Singapore released on July 16, 2020 shows a nurse place microchip on one of the twin red-ruffed lemur babies during its first health check up at the animal hospital for Singapore Zoo. Photo: Wildlife Reserves Singapore via AFP Her move to the country was planned and coordinated as part of an ex-situ conservation programme under the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria. "The couple was specially matched because of their genetic compatibility... as part of ongoing conservation breeding efforts between zoological institutions to protect wildlife and biodiversity," said WRS in a media release. "Reproduction for these rust-coloured primates is notoriously difficult as they only breed once a year. "On top of this, females are only fertile for one out of the few days they are sexually receptive, making this twin birth particularly special," WRS added.  Red ruffed lemurs are classified as critically endangered under the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. The main threats to them are habitat loss due to illegal logging and hunting. They live together as a family and so are often hunted in groups. Native to northeastern Madagascar, the red ruffed lemur is a sister species to the black and white ruffed lemurs. Even though the two species do not coexist in the same geographical range, they are able to understand each other’s calls and communicate. CNA For more stories like this, visit cna.asia.

[2020-07-16 19:29:25.352965] INFO newsparser:237: content : NEW YORK/SINGAPORE — Car alarms, jackhammers, a drunken argument and the rumble of the No 7 train in New York passing overhead. It is the glorious urban symphony that pours into a typical New York City apartment building day and night. Sure, closing the window can help, but there goes your natural ventilation. What if there were technology to cancel the offending clamor, like a pair of giant noise-canceling headphones for your apartment? Researchers in Singapore have developed an apparatus that can be placed in a window to reduce incoming sound by 10 decibels. The system was created by a team of scientists, including Dr Masaharu Nishimura, who came up with the basic concept, and Dr Bhan Lam, a researcher at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore (NTU). “I grew up in Singapore,” Dr Lam said in a Zoom interview from his apartment there. “It’s a small city with a lot of noise, so I have some motivation to solve this problem.” Their results were published Thursday (July 9) in Scientific Reports. The prototype is not yet the most practical device in real-world conditions, but it points the way toward the development of technologies that may help ease the strain of noisy city living. Read also: Underground silencers cut noise from tunnel ventilation fans at night: SMRT Borrowing from the same technological principles used in noise-canceling headphones, the team expanded the concept to fit an entire room by placing 24 small speakers in a window. The speakers emit sound waves that correspond to the incoming racket and neutralize it — or at least some of it. The system is based on the frequency of the sound waves, and for now, the optimal range is between 300 and 1,000 hz. In Singapore, a city near the equator where temperatures are often high, overlapping transportation systems and the desire for natural ventilation in modern high-rise apartment towers can pose a healthy-living conundrum. Read also: SMRT should reduce noise from overnight work at Tanjong Pagar MRT Station Dr Lam explained that “in places like Singapore, we want to keep the windows open as much as possible” to reduce the use of carbon-intensive air conditioners and to prevent buildup of stale air that can pose health risks for some people. But with windows open, the constant din from city traffic, trains, jets passing overhead and construction equipment can rattle apartments. The Anti-Noise Control Window, as it is called, is the sonic equivalent of shutting a window. With any sound, the best way to reduce it is at the source, like a gun’s silencer. So the researchers treated the window aperture itself as the noise source because most noise enters a room that way. The system uses a microphone outside the window to detect the repeating sound waves of the offending noise source, which is registered by a computer controller. That in turn deciphers the proper wave frequency needed to neutralise the sound, which is transmitted to the array of speakers on the inside of the window frame. The speakers then emit the proper “anti” waves, which cancel out the incoming waves, and there you have it: Near blissful silence. “If you sit in the room, you get that same feeling like when you flick on the switch of noise-canceling earphones,” Dr Lam said, splaying his hands to denote the calming effect. The system is best at attenuating the audible blasts from the types of steady noise sources found within the optimal frequency range. Unfortunately, human voices do not fit within most of that range. One of the next hurdles will be to find a way to silence loud conversations from across the way. Another limitation is that the system is not good at neutralizing sporadic noises, like firecrackers, car horns or the occasional earsplitting crash of metal storefront shutters — the kinds of noises that drive many New Yorkers to slam their windows shut. One reason for the limitation on frequency is the size of the speakers. To cancel out lower frequencies would require larger bass speakers. But those would interfere with ventilation and your ability to see through the window. It’s a trade-off, and one solution might be installing larger windows, or discovering a way to make it work with smaller speakers. As it is, the 24 speakers, each about 2 inches in diameter, are a bit of an aesthetic hindrance. “One complaint that we get is that it’s ugly,” Dr Lam said. But if it can neutralise the sound of the jet taking off from runway 13 at LaGuardia, that is (soft) music to the ears. THE NEW YORK TIMES

[2020-07-16 19:29:59.070625] INFO newsparser:237: content : SINGAPORE – A senior constituency manager at the Residents' Committees (RCs) of two zones in Pasir Ris reused payment vouchers from one of his zones to claim cash from the vice-chairman of the other zone. He lied to the vice-chairman of Pasir Ris Zone 8 that he had used his own money to pay vendors and wanted reimbursement, and received four cheques amounting to S$5,919.27 for invoices already paid for by Pasir Ris Zone 7. For his crimes, 37-year-old Li Xuanwei was sentenced on Thursday (Jul 16) to 12 weeks' jail. He pleaded guilty to two counts of cheating, with another two charges taken into consideration. He is no longer with the RC. The court heard that Li joined the People's Association in March 2008 as a constituency manager, and later became a senior constituency manager at the RCs of Pasir Ris Zone 7 and Zone 8. In October 2015, the Housing and Development Board (HDB), along with Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council and its RCs embarked on a neighbourhood renewal programme to improve amenities in its precincts. Read also: Duo to be charged with cheating 8 banks in Singapore, HK of more than S$470m This programme was fully funded by the Government and implemented by the town council, the court heard. As the programme required the support of at least 75 per cent of the residents, the RCs of Pasir Ris Zones 7 and 8 were tasked with organising an event to explain the programme to residents and garner their votes. Li was tasked to organise a one-day event on Mar 3, 2018. He engaged the vendors, prepared payment vouchers and cheques with supporting documents, and presented them to the RC chairman of Pasir Ris Zone 7. Read also: Two ex-directors charged in separate cheating cases  After the chairman signed the cheques, Li made payments to the vendors. However, he reused these payment vouchers with supporting invoices and receipts and made fraudulent claims from the RC vice-chairman of Zone 8, Mr Rajeev Divakaran Nair. He deceived Mr Rajeev into believing that he had used his own cash to pay the vendors and so needed reimbursement. He tricked Mr Rajeev at Pasir Ris Zone 8 RC on Apr 19, 2018, claiming that he had paid S$504 for sculpting balloons and S$1,016 for bags. Mr Rajeev believed him and gave him a sum of S$1,521. Read also: Covid-19: Man charged after allegedly cheating company of almost S$1m by posing as an N95 mask supplier A few months later on July 4, 2018, Li again cheated Mr Rajeev by saying he had paid S$2,199 for unspecified expenses for the programme, and received this sum as a "reimbursement". Fraud uncovered after audit  The fraud was uncovered by the constituency director of Pasir Ris East Constituency Office in August 2018 after an internal audit was conducted of the accounts. He confronted Li, who admitted to cheating Pasir Ris Zone 8 by recycling invoices that had already been paid by Pasir Ris Zone 7. Li made full restitution to Pasir Ris Zone 8 on Aug 10, 2018, and the constituency director lodged a police report later that year. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Yen Seow sought at least 15 weeks' jail, noting that Li had committed "premeditated offences against a public institution". He said the RC exists for the public good and serves to promote the welfare of its residents, relying on "limited public funds to deliver its mission". "The accused played a critical role in safeguarding and ensuring the judicious use of these funds," said Mr Tan. "Despite knowing this, the accused saw it fit to abuse his longstanding position of trust and authority in the RC by diverting $5,919.27 of such public funds to himself." In doing so, Li defrauded not only the chairman and vice-chairman of the RC, but also all the residents under the RC’s purview, said Mr Tan.  "Such dishonest conduct strikes at the heart of the RC’s mission and tarnishes the good reputation of other officers in a similar capacity as the accused," he added. Such crimes are difficult to detect, as shown by the fact that four such scams went undetected for about five months, said the prosecutor. He noted that Li had pleaded guilty. For each charge of cheating, Li could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined.  CNA For more stories like this, visit cna.asia.

[2020-07-16 19:31:41.383723] INFO newsparser:237: content :   SINGAPORE — Singapore should not choose between China and the United States for as long as it can, although South-east Asian countries had been pressed to take sides as the rivalry between the two powers intensify, Ambassador-at-Large Chan Heng Chee said. “Singapore will not be put in a position to make a final choice like a marriage, nor need it. We should not make a choice for as long as we can,” she said on Wednesday (July 15) when delivering an online lecture hosted by the independent think-tank Institute of Policy Studies (IPS). Choice will be exercised by each country to line up with the US or China depending on what the two powers put on the table, the former Ambassador to the US said. Also stressing that the choice is “not binary”, she said: “The indications are that no country in Europe or Asia would like an exclusive relationship with the US or China… All want to be able to develop relations with both powers.” Professor Chan believes that Singapore will continue to see the US as “the preferred strategic and defence partner or friend in Asia” in the next decade or two, if it is not seen to be retrenching its interests.

But it will not just be about how many US or Chinese initiatives a country selects from each side. “The question is whether strategic choices are more important than economic choices and are more telling, revealing. But increasingly, it can also be argued that economics and markets is hard power, too, and just as fundamental.” Read also: Explainer: How Trump’s order to end HK’s special trading status will affect businesses, immigration processes When asked by a member of the audience if it is indeed possible for Singapore to maintain close ties with both the US and China, Prof Chan said that people will read what they want to read in all initiatives. “Sometimes, people tell us we are too pro-US. Sometimes, the Americans say we are too pro-China, so we must be somewhere in the middle… We are dead centre.” ALIGNMENTS ‘WILL BE DIFFERENT’ SHOULD COLD WAR ARISE Read also: Caught in ‘ideological spiral,’ US and China drift toward Cold War Prof Chan was delivering the last of her lecture series as an SR Nathan fellow of IPS. In the wide-ranging lecture, she gave her analysis on the recently concluded General Election and spoke about how the Singapore Government should focus more efforts on helping small- and medium-sized enterprises and approach the issue of rising inequality, among other things. Her final lecture was titled, Singapore in a Time of Flux: Optimism from the Jaws of Gloom. Prof Chan concluded it by saying that she is optimistic of Singapore’s outlook in a time of flux, although she recognised that it will become “harder increasingly” to navigate the waters ahead. She then said: “If there be a Cold War 2.0 or 1.5, it will look different and alignments will be different. It will not be the old Cold War. Countries will want to have relationships with both powers.” Earlier in her lecture, Prof Chan noted that there is an emergence of a consolidation of like-minded countries that “simply want to carry on doing their business, supporting their growth and development”. “They are just like-minded countries who can work together on specific issues,” she said. For instance, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Singapore forged co-operation with six countries — Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Myanmar and New Zealand — to ensure that trade lines remained opened for the flow of goods and essential supplies. Singapore and 12 other countries, which included neither the US nor China, also pledged to pool research and scientific resources and share findings in an effort that “clearly (took) a neutral path”, she noted. Regionalism or coalitions of a few states for very practical purposes on how to deal with the opening up after the pandemic — this may “point the way to newer regional subgroupings”, she believes. Given that there is a lack of global leadership, such regional groupings are trying to come together to “make up for a deficit” by offering regional leadership, she added. “Today, the world is getting very complex, so it is very hard to see giants stride across the stage. You would be lucky, for the leader, if they do not leave the stage with their tail hanging behind them.”  In ending her speech, Prof Chan said: “We cannot predict the future but we must be optimistic and active... we look for solutions and build a path forward. Gloom is not destiny.”

[2020-07-16 19:32:16.285994] INFO newsparser:237: content : SINGAPORE — In another escalation of tensions between the United States and China, US President Donald Trump signed an order on Wednesday (July 15) that will end Hong Kong’s special trading status that it had enjoyed for almost three decades.  The move comes after China imposed national security laws on the territory that critics say is in violation of its “one country, two system” principle, effectively ending the city’s autonomy from mainland China. Mr Trump also signed a new legislation called the Hong Kong Autonomy Act that will sanction individuals and banks found to be doing business with Chinese officials who are enforcing the new national security laws.  China has hit back at Mr Trump, with its foreign affairs ministry saying that it will also impose sanctions on American businesses and individuals if the US does not correct its course.  So what do these all mean? And how will they affect the already fraught trade tensions between both countries? WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS? Read also: China vows retaliation after Trump ends preferential status for Hong Kong The ending of Hong Kong’s preferential treatment essentially means that the privileges that companies and individuals in Hong Kong have enjoyed, which have not been extended to mainland China, will most likely cease.

This is because they can escape the export controls that the US imposes on Chinese firms through Hong Kong.  Read also: Angering China, Australia suspends extradition treaty with Hong Kong, extends visas Mr Trump’s order effectively closes this “backdoor”, thereby increasing costs for these companies that trade with the US.  WHAT WOULD IT MEAN FOR GLOBAL TRADE?  Calling this latest tit-for-tat development between the US and China a “major turning point” in geopolitics, Mr Capri said that many more companies and individuals could potentially be seen as contributing to the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy and end up being sanctioned.  Read also: Australia warns citizens in Hong Kong of detention risk “The net is cast much, much farther and much wider, there are many vulnerable companies within that ecosystem,” he added.  This could have an impact on Hong Kong startups that have numerous cross-fertilisation of ideas with those in Shenzhen, or blockchain companies working with banks to digitise the Renminbi currency.  Economist Song Seng Wun from CIMB Private Banking said that companies may have to start thinking about relocating to other places in order to operate in a more “neutral zone”.  Senior economist Irvin Seah from DBS bank said that the importance of Hong Kong as a trading hub for high-value IT products will be diluted.  Some trade diversion of these high-tech products may be rerouted to member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, he added.  However, the impact on China would be relatively smaller compared with the other trade actions that the US has taken on its competitor over the last two years, Mr Seah said. More importantly, he pointed out that this would spur China to invest more heavily in developing its own technology.  “This could eventually lead to the bifurcation of technology globally,” he said, referring to the digital and innovation divide that could affect everything from smartphones to Wi-Fi networks.

[2020-07-16 19:32:58.755443] INFO newsparser:237: content :   SINGAPORE — When opposition parties failed to make a dent at the ballot box during the 2015 General Election (GE), analysts predicted that the smaller outfits would consolidate or reorganise to hold their own against the big guns. At the time, with the exception of the Workers’ Party (WP), the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) and the Singapore People’s Party (SPP), all other opposition parties registered less than 30 per cent of the vote share at the constituencies where they stood. Yet, for the GE this year, the number of opposition parties has grown — from eight in 2015 to 10. There were six in 2011. Their showing at the latest polls has also been fairly successful, with the opposition parties registering close to 39 per cent of the overall vote share. None of the parties, except one, lost their election deposits in the constituencies they contested. Candidates need to garner a minimum of 12.5 per cent of the vote to avoid forfeiting the S$13,500 deposit. Read also: PAP has to better understand millennials to win back votes, says Ambassador-at-Large Chan Heng Chee  The sole party to lose its deposit was Peoples Voice, which scored 12.18 per cent of the vote in a three-way fight in Pasir Ris-Punggol Group Representation Constituency (GRC). Mr Cheang Peng Wah, an independent candidate, also lost his deposit in a three-cornered fight in Pioneer Single Member Constituency (SMC). Even newcomers Red Dot United, which got its registration approved just two weeks before Nomination Day, was able to secure about 25 per cent of the vote in Jurong GRC. TODAY looks at why opposition parties continue to enter the fray despite bigger parties dominating the scene, and if predictions of an opposition consolidation will come to pass. Read also: ELD apologises for ‘human error and miscommunication’ which resulted in voter being unable to cast her ballot  INCENTIVES TO CONTEST Political analysts said that there are still incentives for new opposition parties to form, even as more established outfits strengthened their foothold in the political scene. Dr Gillian Koh from the Institute of Policy Studies pointed to the provision of 12 Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) seats, which give opposition candidates an opportunity to be an NCMP even if they lost.

With this GE campaign mostly taking place online, the cost of taking part was also greatly reduced. Ms Michelle Lee, Red Dot United’s chairman, said that had GE2020 been a conventional election, the month-old party would have struggled to raise enough money to fund the cost of holding physical rallies.

Political commentator Eugene Tan said that with a crowded political landscape, it is harder for the smaller parties to remain relevant. Assoc Prof Tan, who is a law professor at the Singapore Management University, believes that consolidation, such as through a formal coalition, a loose alliance or a merger with other parties, is one way forward as this would allow them to pool resources. However, the coalition members have to set aside individual party and personal interests to create a successful alliance, he added.  Some opposition parties interviewed by TODAY said that they would continue to push for a coalition in the lead-up to the next GE. Mr Goh Meng Seng, the secretary-general of People's Power Party (PPP), said that without any “star candidates”, having a bigger-sized coalition would help to inspire voters’ confidence in the parties. It will also help smaller parties such as his gain greater media exposure, he added. An attempt by PPP to form an opposition bloc with the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA), PPP, Reform Party and the now-disbanded Singaporeans First failed to materialise during GE2020 after SDA pulled out. However, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) secretary-general Mohamad Hamim Aliyas remains optimistic that an opposition alliance between his outfit, PPP and Reform Party can be formalised and registered within the next year. Having lobbied for an alliance among several opposition parties two years ago, Mr Lim Tean, the leader of Peoples Voice, is no longer keen on the idea. While he had thought at first that it would be good for the opposition parties to come together, Mr Lim said the “selfish interest” of individual parties meant that opposition unity remains a far-fetched idea. “I now believe that instead of pursuing a fruitless cause for opposition unity, it is better that we work towards a multi-party democracy in Singapore, which is what is happening throughout the world. We can get more diverse views, and diversity is what Singaporeans want,” he said. SMALLER PARTIES HAVE TO 'RAISE STANDARDS' Coalition talks aside, analysts said that the smaller opposition parties will have to raise their standards to stand out from the crowd. Dr Felix Tan, associate lecturer in international relations at SIM Global Education, said that these parties need to groom members and candidates instead of coming across as “fly-by-night” entities. They will also have to be less antagonistic in their messaging and appeal to voters rationally instead. Assistant Professor Walid Jumblatt Abdullah of Nanyang Technological University’s School of Social Sciences said that the smaller parties should also consolidate their resources to contest in either one GRC or SMC to achieve a breakthrough like the WP did in 2011. These parties should also be clearer about what they stand for, rather than what they stand against. So long as the bigger opposition parties such as WP lack the resources to contest every seat in an election, there will continue to be space for smaller opposition parties, Asst Prof Walid said.

[2020-07-16 19:33:32.475562] INFO newsparser:237: content : SINGAPORE — Singapore was at its “youth peak” in the recently concluded General Election (GE), with those aged between 25 and 35 forming the biggest bulge in its population pyramid in 2020, Ambassador-at-Large Chan Heng Chee said. And the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) will have to understand this group better to “win back their vote”, she added. Professor Chan was delivering an online lecture titled, Singapore in a Time of Flux: Optimism from the Jaws of Gloom, on Wednesday (July 15). This was the last of her lecture series as an SR Nathan fellow with the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), a think-tank from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore (NUS).  Prof Chan started her lecture with an analysis of the GE2020 results, which saw PAP lose another Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and taking 61.24 per cent of the popular vote — a drop from the 69.9 per cent it achieved in GE2015 and is its second lowest overall vote share since the country's independence. Prof Chan said that the younger generation, which she termed the “Zoomer generation”, prefers “personal narratives and ‘I feel your pain’ connectivity, approachability and authenticity”. She said: “The Workers' Party understood this and chose youthful candidates and issues for the Zoomer generation... This online digital politics is now the new retail politics — up close and personal.” Read also:  S'pore shouldn't choose between China and US for as long as it can: Ambassador-at-Large Chan Heng Chee The GE saw WP achieve its best ever electoral showing, winning 10 seats including four in the newly formed Sengkang GRC. ‘MILLENNIALS WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT DIVERSE VOICES’ During a press conference held after the final election results were out, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the outcome reflected a desire by younger voters for a greater opposition presence in Parliament. Read also: GE2020 commentary: Assessing the voters’ message to PAP (and other parties) In her lecture, Prof Chan reiterated: “Clearly, this age group bought the opposition message of the need for diverse voices in Parliament and the need for checks and balances.” She added that while it has been “conventional wisdom” that people become more conservative as they grow older, the millennials in Singapore will buck this trend as youth elsewhere have already demonstrated a “distinct and increasingly liberal outlook”. She cited from a Pew Research report that suggested that American millennials and Generation X-ers are different from the Boomers and the Silent Generation, who are 56 years old and above. Read also: GE2020: Clear messages sent by voters, 'soul searching and reflection' needed: Shanmugam “I expect our millennials will continue to support diverse voices and an opposition in Parliament as a good thing even as they age,” Prof Chan predicted. “They will have specific personal concerns, too, in different phases of their lives. The incumbent party will have to understand this group better to win back their vote.” NEW POLITICAL CULTURE EMERGING Read also: GE2020: PAP wins ‘clear mandate’ in historic Covid elections, but couldn’t prevent WP from making further inroads Prof Chan also said it was evident that a new political culture is emerging. “On the one hand is the culture of government that emphasises strong government, effectiveness, a legalistic culture, delivery of public goods and services, and a better life for the people. Critics have characterised the PAP political style as paternalistic,” she said.  “On the other hand, many Singaporeans invoke democracy and want to see Singapore evolve into a full-fledged democracy.” Read also: GE2020: ‘Whole country has to unite’ — WP will work with PAP, other opposition parties, says Pritam Singh She noted that political commentators have asked “why the PAP is asking for a strong mandate, and why it is not more magnanimous in the treatment of opponents”.  “(These commentators) would like to see rules applied to all political participants fairly, that gerrymandering be restrained,” she said. While Singaporeans yearn for democratic competition or competitive politics, they appear to be “repulsed” by the competitive, mean politics of some Western democracies, she noted, adding that educated and younger Singaporeans in particular “do not want to see political overkill”. Read also: GE2020: Sengkang voters hope for new brand of politics, as WP promises ‘the hard work starts tomorrow’ WHAT COULD HAVE AFFECTED VOTE SHARE During the lecture, Prof Chan gave her take on the issues that affected PAP’s vote share. These spanned the party's performance as the Government in the last five years, the Government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in the past five months, as well as the nine days of campaigning for GE2020. She said that voters did not approve of the way the elected presidency was introduced and other policies such as the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act. On the handling of Covid-19, she noted that it was done with a micromanaging of rules and protocols for businesses and a lack of clarity, as fears and anxieties about jobs grew. And when it came to the hustings, “it was about messaging, communicating and the online presence and savviness of the parties”. During a question-and-answer segment of the lecture, Prof Chan, who was in the nine-member Constitutional Commission to review the elected presidency system in 2016, was asked if she would approach the review differently with hindsight. Following the review, constitutional amendments were passed to reserve the elected presidency for candidates of a particular racial group if there had not been a president from that group for the five most recent presidential terms. Prof Chan stated in her reply that she supports any mechanism that allows for better representation of the country’s different ethnic groups. Noting that the presidency is a “symbol of the country”, she added: “It must unify the country, and it must represent what the country looks like in terms of its demography in the city.” MAKING ROOM FOR ALTERNATIVE VIEWS Following the elections and in a post-Covid world, Prof Chan questioned if Singapore’s governance model is adequate. She said that Singapore “must make room for alternative views” as it looks to the future with an ambition of harnessing the new economy and finding unconventional opportunities. “To harvest the opportunities out there, to think the unthinkable, we must expand intellectual space — giving more room for expression to encourage Singaporeans, especially young Singaporeans, to be bold, to think differently, think innovatively.” Adding that the country should “seriously discourage groupthink”, she said: “In a successful bureaucracy, it is even more necessary to allow out-of-the-box thinking within. If our political model needs fixing, it is how to accommodate differences and diverse views in our institutions and our country.”   The civil service also needs to evolve, she said, adding that civil servants “should think very hard and make sure that we don’t allow groupthink to infect us”. Policies should be implemented with a “human touch”, with Prof Chan calling it a “very cold implementation of policy” when people go by the playbook or standard operating procedures, or are overly concerned about practising some discretion. “It goes to the ground. We should do it intelligently with a feel of the ground,” she said. Asked how the young may be educated differently to thrive in a more complex political environment, she said that the challenge lies in breaking up silos built by technology and the digital world. “We are all just going into the websites or the chat groups of, maybe, our own kind, our own values, our own politics, so we are quite siloed,” she added. In order to break up these silos, a “whole bunch of actions, not just one action” have to happen in schools and the social space, such as consciously ensuring diversity when hiring employees or sending out invites to a party, Prof Chan said.

[2020-07-16 19:34:06.239347] INFO newsparser:237: content : SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Education’s (MOE) response when there are Covid-19 cases in schools is to "ring-fence" students and teachers, put them on leave of absence and to do it on a "small scale" instead of fully closing schools, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Thursday (July 16). His comments come after a 13-year-old girl from Jurong West Secondary School was wrongly diagnosed with Covid-19 because of mislabelled samples at a hospital laboratory. Before the error was discovered, it was thought that she had contracted Covid-19 from another student at the school who had earlier tested positive for the virus. Responding to a question about MOE's contingency plan in the event of student-to-student transmission in schools, Mr Ong said: “So the approach is always, you need to ring-fence and quarantine and put students and teachers on that leave of absence, but do it in as small (a) scale as possible. “So if you can do that for a class, to keep the school safe, do so, if not (do it) at (the) level. And if not, maybe a school, as opposed to always reacting to a full closure or full opening. I don't think that is appropriate.” Speaking to reporters after a visit to Tampines Secondary School for Racial Harmony Day, Mr Ong said he was “very comforted” that parents and teachers mostly understood the actions taken by MOE. Read also: Secondary school student mistakenly diagnosed with Covid-19 due to human error at lab: MOH “Like Jurong West Secondary School, I was most comforted that when we closed that whole level, (Secondary) 1, the other levels, like 90 over per cent came back to school,” he added. “That means they understood by ring-fencing that level, the rest of the school is actually safe. Because of the measures, they don't intermingle. So I think so long as we can keep those procedures in place, parents, teachers understand, students understand. Then I think we can make life as normal as we can.” Noting that many school activities have not resumed, Mr Ong said MOE will have to understand the virus and its transmission, and constantly review its approach.

[2020-07-16 19:34:40.116636] INFO newsparser:237: content : SINGAPORE — Despite the economic slump as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the existing cooling measures for the property market will stay, the head of Singapore’s central bank said. Mr Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), said that this is because the property market has remained stable as a result of previous property curbs. There are also the temporary relief measures available for developers and homebuyers who have been affected by Covid-19.  “The adjustment of the property market has been modest. Property prices have moderated in an orderly manner in recent months,” Mr Menon said on Thursday (July 16) during the release of MAS Annual Report.  “The property cooling measures — progressively implemented over the last 10 years — have helped to temper price increases and bring prices more in line with underlying economic fundamentals,” he added.  Prices of private residential properties have declined 1.1 per cent in the second quarter of this year, as shown by flash estimates published earlier by the Urban Redevelopment Authority.  Property cooling measures have been progressively rolled out almost every year since 2009, with the previous set of measures in 2018 effectively bringing down huge price hikes.  Read also: Showflats reopening, low interest rates among reasons behind doubling of private home sales, analysts say To help developers whose projects have been delayed by Covid-19, the Ministry of National Development has extended the schedule allowed to complete their projects by six months.  Couples looking to claw back the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty when buying a new private property will have one year, instead of six months, to sell their existing property.  Singaporean married couples buying a second property have to pay an additional 12 per cent of the property price as the stamp duty, but they can get a remission of the stamp duty if they sell their first property in six months, now extended to a year.  Read also: How will Covid-19 and cooling measures such as ABSD impact the property market? “The stabilisation of the property market has substantially reduced its vulnerability to the Covid-19 shock. If property prices had been rising rapidly as we entered the Covid-19 crisis, we could have seen a sharp and painful correction,” Mr Menon said.  He added that MAS, along with other government agencies, will continue to watch the market closely to ensure that prices for private homes remain in line with economic fundamentals.  When asked whether the spike in the sales of private housing units last month was an anomaly or a sign of a worrying trend, Mr Menon said: “Frankly, I don’t know.  Read also: 6-month time extension for property developers, homeowners affected by Covid-19 “There are people who think (prices) might go up, there are people who think it might go down. On balance, it’s pretty much staying where it is. Month to month, you will see spikes, some of it is pent-up,” he added.  He also said that the authorities take a longer-term perspective on trends in the property market.  “We watch these trends very closely to see if they signify a persistent trend or pattern that might suggest a discontinuity, meaning a sharp collapse or a sudden surge. We need to now look at both possibilities and guard against it.”

[2020-07-16 19:35:13.738947] INFO newsparser:237: content :   SINGAPORE — A 28-year-old man, who was described as a “monster” by the prosecution for prostituting his wife and sexually abusing his daughter, failed in his appeal on Thursday (July 16) for a lighter sentence.   He had been sentenced in the High Court a year ago to 25-and-a-half years’ jail, the maximum 24 strokes of the cane and a S$12,000 fine.  He had pleaded guilty to four charges of prostituting his wife, forcing their six-year-old daughter to perform sexual acts on him and molesting his 13-year-old niece in a hotel room. The man is currently serving his sentence and cannot be named in order to protect his victims’ identities. Last year, he had mumbled incoherently in court as he appealed against his sentence, leaving the court perplexed. The judges then adjourned the case for him to hire a lawyer.  On Thursday, he appeared in the Court of Appeal with his new lawyer, Mr Mohammad Shafiq Haja Maideen from Abdul Rahman Law Corporation.  Mr Shafiq argued for his client’s sentence to be reduced to 18 years’ jail and 12 strokes of the cane. He said that High Court judge Chan Seng Onn had wrongly analysed some offence-specific factors and allowed the “disgust factor” of the accused’s conduct to cloud his judgment. Justice Chan had echoed the prosecution in describing the acts as monstrous, further noting that he had sexually exploited and abused three female relatives. Judge of Appeal Judith Prakash, who heard the appeal with Judge of Appeal Tay Yong Kwang and Justice Woo Bih Li, said on Thursday that the criticisms of Justice Chan were “unwarranted” and his description of the man’s behaviour was “not exaggerated and extreme in any way”.  They were reflective of the general societal view that a father, husband and uncle should be responsible for his female relatives, Judge of Appeal Prakash added. She said that the man had committed grave abuse of trust as his daughter was entitled to expect her father to protect her from harm rather than inflict it. “The abuse of trust of a vulnerable person is qualitative. Even one instance is one too many and must be given due weight,” she noted. While Mr Shafiq had applied to produce three medical reports as further evidence, he did not rely on them in his arguments.  The court was previously told that the man was on medication for epilepsy and high blood pressure. The three judges dismissed the appeal, which was heard over video-conferencing platform Zoom in light of Covid-19 safe distancing measures. THE CASE The man began physically assaulting his wife while they were dating and ramped up his abuse after they got married in 2012.  The abuse continued during her pregnancies. The couple also have a younger son in addition to the daughter whom he sexually abused. Four years into their marriage, he demanded that his wife provide sexual services to pay for their infant son’s milk powder and other household expenses. The wife was reluctant at first but eventually succumbed out of fear that he would intensify his physical assaults.  They were facing financial difficulties as she had stopped working as a receptionist the year before while the man was unemployed.  He rejected her suggestion that she look for a job, insisting that prostitution was a “quick and lucrative” means of earning money to sustain their family, prosecutors said. Following his instructions, she began soliciting customers on a website that he used to engage prostitutes. If she could not meet a daily quota of customers set by him, he would force her to get more customers the following day. He also asked her to secretly record the encounters and give him the recordings afterwards. Between June and late August 2016, she ended up servicing 138 customers and earning nearly S$11,000 — money which she handed over to him. During a stay at Value Hotel Balestier in July 2016, he forced his daughter to perform sex acts on him while his wife was in the toilet. She stopped him when she saw what was happening but he threatened to beat them up if they told anyone about it. On Aug 1, 2016, he insisted that his wife bring her niece to him. She refused but when he threatened to continue hitting her, she dragged the girl out of school.  She took the girl to Value Hotel Thomson where her husband molested the girl.  The man’s mother called the police about three weeks later after she learned about how he had abused his daughter.

[2020-07-16 19:35:55.762751] INFO newsparser:237: content : SINGAPORE — The Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) on Thursday (July 16) called on the authorities to account for the “irregular events” that occurred during the General Election (GE) last Friday. It also wants an inquiry to be opened to look into the use of tendered ballot slips, which were not counted. This comes a day after the Elections Department (ELD) apologised for “human error and miscommunication” that led to a 36-year-old voter being unable to cast her ballot. The woman, who belonged to Holland-Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency where the SDP contested and lost with 33.64 per cent of the vote, had made a police report when she ended up marking her choice on a tendered ballot paper, which would not be counted. In a media release, SDP chairman Paul Tambyah stated that the party is “very concerned” with the development. He asked ELD to reveal how many such irregular events happened during the polls.  He also called for an independent inquiry to be convened to look into the conduct of the election with a focus on the use of tendered ballot slips. Read also: ELD apologises for ‘human error and miscommunication’ which resulted in voter being unable to cast her ballot  Tendered ballot papers are issued to individuals who apply to cast their vote even after the Presiding Officer — an election official who conducts and assists with polling proceedings at a polling station — has informed them that they have already voted. The Parliamentary Elections Act states that these votes are not counted and will instead be placed into separate packets, sealed and retained. According to the Act, tendered votes are only required for the purposes of an application to void the election of a candidate on certain grounds, including in the event that illegal practices were committed. Read also: Elections Department to conduct thorough review of what went wrong on Polling Day The inquiry, Dr Tambyah added, should be reviewed by all political parties who took part in the GE. He also said that the ELD should be removed from the Prime Minister’s Office and placed under an independent organisation that reports to all registered political parties in Singapore and is “answerable” to Singaporeans. Dr Tambyah said the incident with the female voter emphasises the problems associated with calling a “snap election in the middle of a pandemic”.

These include long queues at several counting stations, the change of instructions on the use of disposable gloves, and the “sudden and unexpected” extension of voting hours to 10pm. The ELD had said that the extension, which came less than an hour before it was originally supposed to end at 8pm last Friday, was to allow enough time for all voters to cast their ballots.

[2020-07-16 19:36:33.475471] INFO newsparser:237: content :   SINGAPORE — The global economy is heading for a recession unlike any other, with “substantial uncertainty” in the months ahead as countries reel from the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, said Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) managing director Ravi Menon.  And Singapore, which is seeing its most severe economic downturn since independence, will feel the effects of this.  The trade-reliant economy already contracted 6.5 per cent in the first half of 2020, with construction, travel-related and customer-facing domestic services bearing the brunt of the fallout.  Speaking at the release of the MAS annual report on Thursday (July 16), Mr Menon said: “The economic situation remains dire. We are not at the beginning of the end, but rather at the end of the beginning.”  Unemployment and corporate bankruptcies will rise, and individuals and companies will have higher levels of debt, he said.  Read also: Singapore’s economic slump may have bottomed out but job losses, wage cuts likely to continue: Economists The global economic contraction in the second quarter of this year is likely to be even deeper than in the first quarter as this is when many economies outside of China were most severely affected by the coronavirus outbreak, with many implementing lockdowns to contain the spread, added Mr Menon. The global economy already registered a 14 per cent quarter-on-quarter decline in the first quarter of this year — almost three times the sharpest decline seen during the 2009 global financial crisis.  The MAS expects the global economy to grow by 3.5 per cent in the second half of this year, after contracting by about 5.5 per cent in the first half.  Read also: Singapore in recession after GDP shrinks 41.2% in Q2 from preceding quarter due to Covid-19 Despite these predictions, Mr Menon said there will still be “substantial uncertainty”, mainly because nobody can predict the trajectory of the Covid-19 pandemic.  “If there are new waves of infection, it could lead to a return of containment measures that drag down economic activity again. Even if subsequent waves of infection are more limited, it is not clear if confidence in resuming normal economic activities will return fully. It is also not clear to what extent the destruction unleashed by the pandemic in the first half of this year has damaged the productive capacity of economies,” he said.  WEAK RECOVERY  Read also: Five suggestions for Singaporeans to cope with Covid-19 outbreak While the global economy will recover, it is likely to be weak and gradual over the long term even though a short-term growth bounce could occur, noted Mr Menon.  People may be hesitant to return to previous patterns of work out of fear of the virus, he said.   Many may also tighten their purse strings as a result of job and pay cuts, while businesses are likely to hold back investments.  “There may be lasting shifts in demand patterns and the associated disruptions in business activities. Changes in supply chains – with a shift in emphasis from efficiency to resilience – may also exert a drag on economic recovery,” said Mr Menon.  Any recovery will be uneven across countries, industries and time, he added.  Despite its first-ever economic contraction in close to 30 years in the first quarter, China is still expected to grow by about 1 per cent this year, making it the only large economy to expand.  The Eurozone economy as a whole is expected to shrink 9 per cent while the outlook for the United States is mixed, said Mr Menon.  Meanwhile, the economies of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam are projected to contract by 2.6 per cent.  OUTLOOK FOR SINGAPORE  In Singapore, the sectors worst hit by the pandemic — construction, travel and customer-facing domestic services — each make up about 4 per cent of the city-state’s gross domestic product (GDP).  This means that about 12 per cent of the economy is at the epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic, said Mr Menon.  These worst-hit activities will take time to recover and even if there is growth in the second half of this year, it will not be enough to restore them to levels before the crisis, he said.  As for trade-related services, a strong demand for pharmaceutical products could offset some weak external demand and disruptions in global supply chains. Meanwhile, growth in modern services, which include ICT and financial services, is likely to slow down, he said.  While a slowdown is expected in the financial services sector, it is not expected to cross into negative territory.  The financial services has emerged relatively unscathed from the Covid-19 crisis, growing 5 per cent in the first half of this year, faster than the 4.1 per cent growth in 2019.  The total number of jobs in the sector actually grew by 2,200 and there has not been any increase in retrenchments thus far.  “It is encouraging that some major financial institutions have committed not to shed any workers due to the Covid-19 crisis. For the year as a whole, MAS expects the financial services sector to still be a net creator of jobs, albeit much lower than in previous years,” said Mr Menon.  Mr Menon reiterated the Government’s official forecast of Singapore’s economy shrinking by between 4 and 7 per cent this year, with core and headline inflation coming in at between -1 and 0 per cent.  When asked during a press conference on whether the forecast range could be revised, Mr Menon said that both upward or downward revisions are possible.  A worse-than-expected contraction could happen if there is a serious second wave of Covid-19 infections and many countries go into lockdowns.  On the flipside, some industries might experience strong V-shaped recoveries.  However, Mr Menon said the key point is not to focus on the forecast range but to ensure that unemployment and business closures remain as low as possible.  “Even if the growth rates pick up in the second half, and they will pick up in the second half, that tail effect of what we just went through will mean corporate bankruptcies will rise in the second half. Again, some of that is inevitable, some of that is a natural part of how the economy adjusts and restructures so that resources flow into new areas,” he said.  “We want to make sure that process is well managed and orderly... But if it gets very large, disorderly and it creates a lot of dislocation — supply chains, worker layoffs and so on —  then it's a serious problem.”  MAS’ FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE  For the financial year of 2019 and 2020 ending March 31, the central bank made a net profit of S$10.6 billion — a 44.8 per cent decline from the S$19.2 billion profit it made in the last financial year.  The decline was mainly due to lower investment income arising out of a “sharp decline in the global markets” in the final quarter of the year, said MAS in its annual report.  Half of its profit, amounting to S$5.3 billion, will be returned to the Government while the rest will be added to MAS’ reserves, said Mr Menon.
